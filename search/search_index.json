Each region has its own, and they have developed and evolved over the years. To keep them alive, they must be transmitted from generation to generation, verbally and in writing, so that their existence will be known in the future, but also through community events where specific techniques and knowledge are taught. Craftsmanship has been a major thread of local traditions, but with the advent of industrialization, it has been diminished. Ceramics is one of the earliest and most rudimentary production processes that human beings developed. Clay was an abundant, easily mined, and intuitive material to begin experimenting with and modelling objects. They used it to build objects and tools to improve their quality of life and be more efficient. Quickly, techniques were created to work with clay, such as modelling, potter\u2019s wheel, molds, extruders, etc., up to one of the most innovative of all, which is 3D printing with clay. Despite having been discovered millions of years ago, it is still a material with great potential and endless possibilities. From the construction of buildings, thanks to their great ability to resist compression, to a decorative vase that is apparently fragile and brittle. This wide range of possibilities gives this material richness and interest that few others can say the same about. In addition, it is a very useful material that creates an experience during its interaction and brings a process of reflection, patience, and introspection. Unfortunately, the pace of life that society and everyday life lead us to does not allow us to enjoy these processes of pause and reflection. Social networks, the search for extreme efficiency, and capitalism\u2026 take us away from crafts and traditions. However, there are still people, to whom we should be grateful, who still work with crafts, keeping their memories and bringing them closer to modernity, with respect and the will to pass on their knowledge to future generations. Catalonia has been a very important centre of ceramics, with several towns with a great reputation for the traditions that have been generated around them, such as Breda, Quart, or La Bisbal d\u2019Empord\u00e0. The abundant clay soil of much of Catalonia has allowed this craft to develop and be one of the main economic engines of many regions. In addition, the climatic conditions favor the entire ceramic process, allowing suitable drying without requiring additional technologies. Ceramics is part of the popular culture of many populations, but there are fewer and fewer ceramists who can continue to work and communicate traditional techniques. In Quart , there are only two potters left who work on ceramics, and it is not because of a lack of work but because young people see more interest in the cities and leave their towns. Therefore, there is a lack of communication about the situation, so a solution would be to promote historical memory with a museum or more pottery training options for new generations. For all this, this project aims to re-evaluate ceramics, with its traditional techniques, and bring it closer to modern society. Combining craftsmanship with innovative production processes and bringing them to the FabLab concept. The duality of craft and technology, digital crafts, local materials and traditions, gamification, local production and international distribution, co-creation, material development, and biomaterial experimentation are some of the intrinsic concepts of the project. Self Development \u00b6 Reflexion and introspection about who I am now and who I want to be at the end of the master\u2019s.

In general, I expect to develop myself personally, to be more open to challenges, and especially more self-confident. I used a M\u00f6bius Strip to represent my evolution because this shape seems like a current strip but is made with a single surface and it creates a loop.

Prototyping tests an abstract hypothesis. This type searches for body interaction between the user and the product tested. It also looks for an experience, how the user learns how to interact with it, for what is meant and creates a positive experience. Finally aims to show and experiment with some details of the shape such as textures, colours, shadows, physical conditions, etc. While working on a design project for a chair, I used role 1. Once I had the chair concept, I made a small prototype to see the proportions, the relations between materials, and how the different pieces fit together. This also helped me to test the interaction with the mechanism because I wanted the chair to be adapted to the height of each user. I also looked for gamification concepts to create a playful experience around the chair, so with the first prototype, I could be able to test it and see how it responded. Finally, I was able to extract conclusions about the fixations of the mechanism, so for the final prototype, I could add them. Role 2: The prototype as a means of inquiry \u00b6 The prototype as a means of inquiry where prototypes are developed and deployed as instruments of inquiry to collect, record and measure phenomena. Explore and understand a phenomenon, situation, or experience to get validation for the final users. Capture information, such as material properties or personal behaviour. Also can provoke a specific situation to collect data on the experience and interaction between the user and the design. Instigate a specific reaction to make the users tell you extreme opinions and situations and get ready for future problems. Asks how people will use the final product, making statistics and getting results. Time and costs will determine the prototype. Role 3: The prototype as a research archetype \u00b6 The prototype as a research archetype as embodiments of concepts, understandings or design spaces that can be argued to constitute contributions to the discipline. Research archetype to physicalize a specific concept (create multiple examples). Critical and conceptual designs also follow the third role because help you, as a designer, to understand the possibilities. Understand yourself and know what I am capable of, what you can do with your local environment and how materials we have around shape the product. The third one, I used it in some way while working on a project for Roc Par\u00e9s, an artist who specializes in interactive communication research. He wanted to develop an analog machine, activated with human energy, that creates a relationship between the user and a water drop. He had this concept, so we needed to design the machine, so we started doing some drawings, 3D models, and renders to conceptualize the design. The Water Drop Viewer had the intention of making the user interact with it and create an experience while looking at a drop of water. This piece reflected on the concept of an exhibition \u201cWhat is possible and what is not\u201d . Through the trial and error of the artistic process, it hopes to make users consider the possibilities of art. Role 4: The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry \u00b6 The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry where the process of making an artefact becomes a qualitative instrumental tool in design research. The way you prototype is what matters. The process and the experience of prototyping are the reasons for developing the design and a way to bring new ideas to the table. Participatory design, collective thinking, sharing ideas and techniques, co-design, etc. It also helps the users get immersed in the process of design and allows exploration. This role can be an autobiographical design process where you dialogue with yourself, asking who you are and what you want to achieve. Finally, the documentation of the process is more important than the result. You may write down or film the prototype to preserve your design process in order to be able to replicate it or upgrade it in the future, as well as to share it and make it an open-source project.

This helps me remember my process and all my advances to see if I am going in the right direction or if I am getting stuck. I think visual maps are a great tool to make my mind clear about my project ideas and define all the concepts that make them grow. Also, these maps help me explain to others my topic and all the different ideas that I am working on. I am interested in the concept of preservation. I define this idea as a way to save a present or past creation so you or others can understand it and continue the work in the future. So, I think new technologies can be helpful to preserve these designs. For example, 3D scanning can make a copy of a physical object to save it in the digital world, so it will last forever, or at least as long as the Internet. Also, having this 3D digital model allows you to make copies or prototypes with 3D printing or other digital fabrication tools and share them with everyone, so anyone can have it digitally or physically. I have also used Instagram to document one of my interventions. I asked ceramicists to share with me the type of clay they use and its origin. I posted images of a piece from each craftsman and a photo of the label of the clay used for each piece. With this, I was able to share the outputs of the intervention with other ceramists, and I started creating a community around this topic. For another intervention, I used digital and printed posters to announce the workshop. For the workshop, we created a workbook to guide the experience but also to have the results documented and be able to draw conclusions from them. Finally, we made a video of the two workshops we held, explaining all the steps, the resulting clay pieces, and the conclusions and feelings everyone had.

Communication Mediums \u00b6 Mediums to communicate my project ideas and development: Weekly newsletter to capture key learnings, what I did, and what I will do differently in the next steps. A printed newspaper/magazine to reach the local community. Printed posters with basic information and announcement of workshops/activities. Present or do a workshop. Website for a specific event. QR code attached to a physical object that leads to a digital space. A physical visual board to explain and get feedback. Infographics. Writing, notes. Photographing/Video Icons or drawings to make it easy to understand the topics presented. Engage individuals 1:1 before & after. Visits to my workspace.

Compiling the experiences I have already had to aid me when pitching or explaining my process to others that can help me. Call for collaboration for partners or participants. Striving for continuity, creating a community. Understand my audience. Offering visibility to others (human or non-human), serve as a bridge, showcase the work of others. Show my work or a specific topic from my own point of view. Simple language for accessibility. Being transparent about my intentions, offering a space where people I am trying to reach and connect can understand better my background, my values, my commitment, my motives, my positionality (creating a foundation for trust). Take quality photos and videos all the time even if I don\u2019t know what they will be for. Experiment with new formats (Twitch). Showing long term commitment. Becoming open and transparent about my making/production processes and materials resourcing.

I quickly established myself in the duality of crafts and technology because it was a field in which I was interested prior to beginning the master\u2019s and in which I had already completed some projects. From this idea, I started thinking about ceramics and the local traditions around them. Catalonia has a long history of pottery, and my mother\u2019s family is from La Bisbal, where ceramics have long been the main economic driver. I started researching the traditions and the current situation, where nowadays craftsmen don\u2019t have a heritage to share their knowledge because new generations are more interested in moving to big cities and studying in innovative fields. However, in Barcelona, there is a boom in doing ceramics, people are interested in doing pottery in their free time, as an activity of introspection and to take a break from their busy lives. So, I find interesting this contradiction where in cities, there is an extended interest in pottery, but in rural areas, we are losing the professionalisation of ceramics. I struggled with the uncertainty of the design process. Sometimes for me, it is difficult to be confident in myself and believe I am doing things right, so with this term that was about exploring without having an objective, I had a lot of ups and downs. I have done some interventions (Pottery with Love and Where Clay Comes From). With these interventions, I have made contact with some interesting people related to pottery.

Activity about how the interaction with clay can help a group of people interact between them. I gave a bunch of clay and plasticine to a group of friends while we were taking a drink in a bar. I asked them to interact with the material and do whatever they wanted. It was interesting how each one did something different, some wanted to replicate an object in their mind, others created something original, but the most interesting one was about playing with clay and enjoying the process without searching for a result. After the bar experience, I recollected the final pieces of clay and 3D scanned them. Following the preservation concept, I wanted to digitalize them to be able to have a copy forever. It is also a means of sharing and replicating something. Once I had the 3D models, I printed some of them with a FDM printer. I wanted to compare the objects to see what differences they had. The 3D-printed shapes had less detail because of the low resolution of 3D scanning, but you can still relate them perfectly to the original shape. Because with slicing, you can generate an infill pattern and change density, the 3D-printed shapes were lighter than the clay ones. Also, the layers of the 3D printer have a different texture, and the colour is similar but brighter. One interesting thing I noticed from 3D printing the shapes is that the copies of plastic still have the ergonomic and tactile shapes that make your hand feel like the object was made by hands, even if it was made entirely by a machine. I also wanted to compare the process of creation, as per a human and as per a 3D printer. The experience in the bar lasted about an hour and a half, and everyone generated lots of shapes and had a great time talking about the experience but also about external conversations. On the other hand, the 3D printer only creates what a human says, and will go directly to the final product, without paying attention to the process. This made me think about how 3D scanning can make everyone generate a 3D model without having to invest a lot of time learning CAD software. Even kids can generate a digital file by only playing with their hands. This activity was the first phase of a possible future intervention. This helped me see how a group of people reacts to an improvised activity and how self-improvisation can be a good option sometimes. Some ideas for possible future interventions could be: 3D printer that improvises and has a mentality? That creates what they want, that changes their mind (undecided).

We asked some colleagues and ceramicists to reflect on how they see love and what their own definition is. This workshop was interesting for me to learn how to organise a workshop, to engage people, and to create an interesting and meaningful experience that can help others reflect on some concepts or start a new activity that can lead to a future hobby. To see how people interact with clay and if they care about which type they use. We asked them to bring their own clay, but at the end, in the studio they usually use the same type of clay, a basic white one that is easy to work with and that is not too dirty (Prai from Sio2). One positive acknowledgement I extract from doing this workshop is that we did it intuitively and without knowing where we wanted to go. We were just interested in working with clay and looking for a reflection on love. I think the design process is usually a difficult path where you can get lost if you are not confident in what you are doing, so trying things and doing them is the best way to gain confidence in ourselves and trust the project. Finally, it was also useful to start creating a community around my project and my context. Doing this workshop in El Torn opened my vision of local ceramics to a new group, which is foreigner ceramicists that came to work or study to Barcelona and do ceramics on their free time.

A weak signal can be defined as an inflexion point where a problem or a situation can be worked on in the present to become better in the future. Playing and combining weak signals helps to explore new fields while organizing ideas and brainstorming, and is useful for the design process. First of all, I selected different cards randomly to get familiar with them and discover new possible fields for our project. This atlas has different categories. First of all, we have the weak signals, separated into five fields: Design for Anthropocene, Life in the Times of Surveillance Capitalism, Kill the Heteropatriarchy, After the Nation-State, and Life after AI - The End of Work, those are the main areas of action. The other types of card are Random Triggers, Areas of Opportunity and Challenges. Weak Signals in The City \u00b6 We were asked to select one of the cards that interested us for our project and search for an example around the city of Barcelona. I chose Personal Fabrication, a Random Trigger Card that focuses on how in the future the population might have a personal lab to produce their products and be able to repair them when one breaks. People will be the consumers but also the producers of the objects, food, clothes, and all the other necessities in our daily lives. Similar to the kitchens that we have nowadays, we would have a space with new production processes, such as 3D printers, laser machines, CNC cutters, etc. My images are about a problem that I had in my fridge and a simple solution that I found. One of the shelves had a plastic piece that helped store food, but it broke and it was impossible to fix. The fridge doesn\u2019t have to replace pieces and you cannot buy new ones, so the shelf was useless because the food fell with the movement of the door. So I thought that with 3D printing I would be able to make a simple piece to help organize the food and prevent it from falling. First of all, I scanned the shelf with a 3D Scanner App to obtain the perfect dimensions and abstract shapes. Then I was able to make a 3D model of the piece based on the scanned shelf. After that, I 3D printed it, and once finished, I was able to place it in the fridge, and it fit perfectly. This is an example of the potential that digital fabrication, personal fabrication, and the revolution of FabLabs have. The users are going to be the consumers but also the producers, so we would be able to fabricate our products personalized and specifically for our context. With this idea, we can repair objects that we would otherwise throw away, generating much less waste. Atlas of Weak Signals Map \u00b6 I started by selecting some Weak Signals for the creation of the project map. The main ones are Rural Futures and Human-Machine Collaborations, because I am interested in this duality between crafts and technology. Another important card is Long-termism. I believe every design has to be long-lasting in terms of material selection, but also the design has to be atemporal in order to prevent the product from becoming outdated. Starting with the Human-Machine Collaborations we can expand to the Fab Lab world, Digital Fabrication, Open-source, AI, etc. All these topics talk about this shift that society has to make to be able to be more sustainable, auto-sufficient, locally regulated and become more collaborative. I believe in Personal Fabrication for the future. I think Industrial Design will change shortly, and everyone will have their own lab or a nearby one to produce their products, or at least to be able to repair and not throw away when something stops working. I think this idea of community laboratories with innovative facilities can be merged with traditional craftsmanship and local artisan work. Rural areas are becoming uninhabited, and cities are becoming overcrowded. Craftsmen don\u2019t have new generations to transfer their knowledge, techniques, and traditions. Therefore, Rural Futures must be included in the project, searching for new materials but with special consideration to ceramics, because of my connection but also for the long-time traditions that Catalonia has alongside this material. So the main point is to help craftsmen expand their work and to have them again as a reference for good design, and to make design promote the union of society. The intersection between Human-Machine Collaborations and Rural Futures can bring new opportunities for artisans to develop their work. With the combination of traditional techniques and innovative ones, we can generate products more attractive and interesting for future generations, revaluing the traditional processes that are getting forgotten.

I started my day by trying to experiment with clay. I wanted to feel it with all my senses. I went to a ceramic studio, and I mixed clay powder with water to start experimenting. Then I poured the liquid clay into a cast board to make it more controllable. I left the studio with a bag full of clay. Local red clay dirties your hands a lot while working with it. I tried to continue my day always with clay in my hands, looking forward to experiencing different activities thanks to the clay\u2019s interaction with me. I also wanted to see how people would react to me. I walked the streets, playing with the clay in my hands.\u2028 \u2028I also wanted to try eating with my dirty hands. So I had lunch while grabbing clay and interacting with all the objects with clay in between. It was difficult to use the fork, but I liked the experience because the smell of the wet clay changed my perception of the food. After that, I decided to share that experience with other people. So in the evening, I met with some friends, and I asked them to play with clay or plasticine while talking and having a beer. I enjoyed that everyone made something unique and experienced the hangout differently. Some people tried to produce a lot, they wanted to impress others and make something special.\u2028 \u2028 On the other hand, others enjoyed the process, they played with the clay while talking, without searching for a result. I saw one of them evolve his ball of clay, he made a lot of shapes with the same clay and destroyed it every time. Finally, he gave me a weird ball that had no social meaning except for the time he spent with it and the conversations that he had around it.\u2028 \u2028 I decided to bring that analogue and physical experience to the digital world. I selected one of the creations, the weird ball. I 3D scanned it to make a digital copy, document it, and preserve it. The preservation of art and traditions is something so important for culture and society, but we are losing it because the world is evolving fast. I used the EM3D app, which works with infrared, to generate a 3D model of the clay ball. After that, I prepared the file for 3D printing with Cura, and I tried to print it with the same characteristics. The result was brilliant, both shapes looked similar. I find this process so interesting because it permits every person to model something in 3D. You don\u2019t need to learn 3D digital software, only with your hands and by experiencing the physical sensations of the clay can you generate something unique and then import it into the digital world. Reflection \u00b6 From that experience, I can draw some conclusions. Introducing the clay to the bar table made everyone participate in the same action, and thanks to that, a lot of conversations were generated. We talked about crafts and traditions. We generated objects from a social experience that reminded me of a moment. With 3D scanning and printing, I can generate copies of and preserve a shape that, given some time, would be destroyed. The connection between the physical and digital, and the traditions and innovation are hybrid concepts that really interest me. Another exploration concept is the time of creation that needs a human person and the time that uses a machine to try to create a similar shape.

I started my day by trying to experiment with clay. I wanted to feel it with all my senses. I went to a ceramic studio, and I mixed clay powder with water to start experimenting. Then I poured the liquid clay into a cast board to make it more controllable. I left the studio with a bag full of clay. Local red clay dirties your hands a lot while working with it. I tried to continue my day always with clay in my hands, looking forward to experiencing different activities thanks to the clay\u2019s interaction with me. I also wanted to see how people would react to me. I walked the streets, playing with the clay in my hands.\u2028 \u2028I also wanted to try eating with my dirty hands. So I had lunch while grabbing clay and interacting with all the objects with clay in between. It was difficult to use the fork, but I liked the experience because the smell of the wet clay changed my perception of the food. After that, I decided to share that experience with other people. So in the evening, I met with some friends, and I asked them to play with clay or plasticine while talking and having a beer. I enjoyed that everyone made something unique and experienced the hangout differently. Some people tried to produce a lot, they wanted to impress others and make something special.\u2028 \u2028 On the other hand, others enjoyed the process, they played with the clay while talking, without searching for a result. I saw one of them evolve his ball of clay, he made a lot of shapes with the same clay and destroyed it every time. Finally, he gave me a weird ball that had no social meaning except for the time he spent with it and the conversations that he had around it.\u2028 \u2028 I decided to bring that analogue and physical experience to the digital world. I selected one of the creations, the weird ball. I 3D scanned it to make a digital copy, document it, and preserve it. The preservation of art and traditions is something so important for culture and society, but we are losing it because the world is evolving fast. I used the EM3D app, which works with infrared, to generate a 3D model of the clay ball. After that, I prepared the file for 3D printing with Cura, and I tried to print it with the same characteristics. The result was brilliant, both shapes looked similar. I find this process so interesting because it permits every person to model something in 3D. You don\u2019t need to learn 3D digital software, only with your hands and by experiencing the physical sensations of the clay can you generate something unique and then import it into the digital world.","title":"Experience"},{"location":"Term1/03-Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#reflection","text":"From that experience, I can draw some conclusions. Introducing the clay to the bar table made everyone participate in the same action, and thanks to that, a lot of conversations were generated. We talked about crafts and traditions. We generated objects from a social experience that reminded me of a moment. With 3D scanning and printing, I can generate copies of and preserve a shape that, given some time, would be destroyed. The connection between the physical and digital, and the traditions and innovation are hybrid concepts that really interest me. Another exploration concept is the time of creation that needs a human person and the time that uses a machine to try to create a similar shape. The time spent by my friend creating the shape was about an hour, he experienced the clay and used that process to share his experience and talk and interact with others.

They are part of a design cooperative called Holon, which works with communities to help with different kinds of human transitions. Markel gave us a tour of the Co\u00f2polis neighbourhood and talked about a cooperative housing project, La Borda, which seeks to facilitate decent, social, affordable housing and a sustainable environment with the aim of promoting new forms of coexistence and generating community through the interrelationship between neighbors. During the week at Co\u00f2polis we also learned about facilitation and explored a deck of cards called \u201cGroup Works\u201d. I found these cards very interesting to visualise all the categories that exist, and it\u2019s a fun and practical way to learn to expand your own limits. I chose the \u201cPlayfullness\u201d card because it seems to me that it is very important to always incorporate a game component in all projects, and at the same time, it seemed to me to be a concept that was defined by the very concept of the cards. Also, I looked at another card, \u201cPower of Restrictions\u201d, because during my design process, I always feel that having restrictions makes the design easier sometimes. This concept is related to the \u201cblank page\u201d, where a creative gets lost because of the infinite possibilities of creation. Finally, we did an exercise on creative communities and were assigned an exercise that I have documented below. Assignment \u00b6 Creatives Community \u00b6 Creative Community: Mobiele Fietsenmaker \u2013 Mobile Bicycle Repairman By Giovanni Putzu mobile bicycle repairman The Netherlands, Brunssum Context: Giving cyclists easier access to bicycle repairs. There used to be at least one bike repairman in nearly every Dutch neighbourhood, but as bicycles have got more reliable, their workload reduced and they closed down. Nowadays there are much fewer such handymen, and the market has been taken over by larger companies. It therefore takes longer to get a bike repaired, and it can of course be difficult actually getting to the repair company. Current Situation: The project has been going for three years, and has attracted a lot of interest. At the moment Giovanni is the only provider of the Mobile Bicycle Repairman service, but he is ready to recruit other repairmen and give them busses to work in other districts. At the same time, a franchising company \u2018Fietsnet\u2019 is preparing a full-scale national project to provide this service (with about 150 vans) all over the country. Engagement & Limits: Society: Providing an easy way for people to have their bikes fixed stimulates people to use their bikes more. Environment: Renovating the bikes prolongs the life cycle of the product. Economy: Users get their bikes repaired conveniently for a good price. The popularity of the service means the provider fulfills a clear need. Some limits could be placed on this service for people who need it regularly. Also, the possible large amount of work that only one van has to cover may be too much. Theory of Change: Designing bikes that are easy to dismantle and reassemble and a standard set of spare parts. Designing suitably light and green mobile repair vans. Designing software and equipment to optimise the logistics of the service. Design Challenges and Opportunities: Create a system similar to car insurance in which clients pay monthly and receive full service for any problematic situation. This would help the service have a regular income and have faithful clients. Reflections \u00b6 During this week, I have learned a lot of tools to get immersed in a community and how to become one member more. My project is about ceramics and local traditions, so I decided to start working with ceramicists from Barcelona. I started thinking about doing a workshop to interact with clay and reflect on our feelings and sensations. Working with clay can be a mindful process where you have to understand the material and its qualities to achieve what you want and also be patient while waiting for the rhythm that clay needs. Together with Marielle, who is looking for love boundaries and also interested in pottery, we organised a workshop in a pottery coworking studio in Poblenou, Barcelona, called El Torn. We had contact with the organiser of the coworking, so it was easy to start engaging people to join the workshop. Before doing this workshop, we did one with our Iaac classmates to practise and see how people follow our instructions and get some feedback. For the El Torn workshop, we prepared a workbook to have a guide, so participants have something physical to follow, and also to collect feedback to analyse after. The activity was about playing with clay, thinking about our feelings, and trying to find our own definition of love. The workshop went really well, people opened up and shared their feelings, they created lots of different clay shapes to define love and the environment was comfortable and safe for everyone. With this intervention, I have learned how to contact people and engage them, how to prepare a workshop for a group, how to guide and create a safe environment, and how to participate and be one more member of the group to experience it from a first-person perspective.

Contextualization \u00b6 In Spain, there are many cases of sexual aggression, generally from men towards women. It is a problem that needs to be solved because many women feel their freedom restricted and in many cases suffer physical or psychological aggressions. There are many types of aggression, and therefore it is difficult to discriminate them by type, but with this project we seek to detect all types of sexist aggression, from a passing glance to a prick. An INE report reveals that in 2021, 3196 sentences were imposed for crimes against sexual freedom and that 97.9% of the aggressors were male. Objectives \u00b6 Goals: The goal of this machine is to detect sexist behavior and remove aggressors from the club so that people can feel free and enjoy the full club experience. These detections are at different levels, such as gestures, glances, touching, expressions or syringe pricks. On the other hand, this machine wants to show everyone whenever aggression is happening, so club users are aware of the high amount of sexism in our society. This system believes in the education model of awareness rather than punishment. Whenever aggression is detected, the song playing in the club changes, so everyone is warned and annoyed. Types of Smart Tasks: The tasks that the machine should be able to do to achieve perfect detection of sexist behaviors are, in the first hand, gesture analysis. This means scanning bodies and establishing relationships between them in order to determine when one of them is invading an individual\u2019s privacy. The next one is face recognition, which scans faces and facial expressions to analyze eyes and lips. Finally, microphones register sounds and conversations to let us know if someone is harassing another person. Dataset Format \u00b6 The technology used for the correct functioning of the machine is based on \u201cmachine learning\u201d. In machine learning, algorithms are trained to find patterns and correlations in large data sets and to make the best decisions and forecasts based on that analysis. Machine learning applications improve with use and become more accurate as they have access to more data. The dataset programmed in the machine will allow the machine to be trained to correctly detect when there is sexist abuse in the clubs. The machine will learn based on questions like: \u201cIs that a machism language?, Is that physical behavior sexist? , etc. If the machine detects something that is wrong, the next time the same situation occurs it will know that it is not a sexist abuse and so on continuously with different situations that it captures. Colab and Dataset used \u00b6 First of all, we were looking for datasets to recognize offensive language. Hate speech and offensive language dataset. Sexist workplace statements Both are an excel spreadsheet where each column is an offensive phrase or word. It was collected from tweets via keywords and hashtags. Colab: Motion Detector The Colab tool has been used to execute Phyton codes to detect movements within clubs. Library name: Alphapose Limitations & opportunities \u00b6 Some limitations of our machine: Recognizing the sounds and conversations in detail is very complex and difficult, especially in crowded clubs because of music and the high volume of voices. In an unlit context, physical recognition could be hard and confusing. Also there should be a lot of cameras or sensors to detect every angle of the club, even if it\u2019s crowded and people cover themselves. Also, the large number of people in the clubs could make it difficult for the machine to control at the same time a lot of situations and possible sexist behaviors. People could feel that their privacy is invaded and that this system is trying to control them. Ethical issues associated with the machine. Should club users sign a contract for the cession of image privacy? Some opportunities to improve it: Additional sensors in some body parts (wrists, ankles) of the users, as bracelets to help the cameras detect precise movements. The machine should incorporate several cameras in order to have different perspectives for image recognition. Night vision cameras or infrared sensors to detect better physical gestures. Make everyone sign a contract to agree on the terms. For ethical issues, only the users who want to be detected by the machine will be given the bracelets.","title":"Extended Intelligences"},{"location":"Term1/06-Extended%20Intelligences/#extended-intelligences","text":"","title":"Extended Intelligences"},{"location":"Term1/06-Extended%20Intelligences/#ai-and-machine-intelligence","text":"A course about Artificial Intelligence and its potential.

Also, the large number of people in the clubs could make it difficult for the machine to control at the same time a lot of situations and possible sexist behaviors. People could feel that their privacy is invaded and that this system is trying to control them. Ethical issues associated with the machine. Should club users sign a contract for the cession of image privacy? Some opportunities to improve it: Additional sensors in some body parts (wrists, ankles) of the users, as bracelets to help the cameras detect precise movements. The machine should incorporate several cameras in order to have different perspectives for image recognition. Night vision cameras or infrared sensors to detect better physical gestures. Make everyone sign a contract to agree on the terms. For ethical issues, only the users who want to be detected by the machine will be given the bracelets.","title":"Limitations &amp; opportunities"},{"location":"Term2/02-Designing%20Next%20Billion%20Seconds/","text":"Designing for the Next Billion Seconds \u00b6","title":"Designing Next Billion Sec"},{"location":"Term2/02-Designing%20Next%20Billion%20Seconds/#designing-for-the-next-billion-seconds","text":"","title":"Designing for the Next Billion Seconds"},{"location":"about/me/","text":"About \u00b6 Product designer from Barcelona with the ambition of searching new shapes between technology and crafts.

Each region has its own, and they have developed and evolved over the years. To keep them alive, they must be transmitted from generation to generation, verbally and in writing, so that their existence will be known in the future, but also through community events where specific techniques and knowledge are taught. Craftsmanship has been a major thread of local traditions, but with the advent of industrialization, it has been diminished. Ceramics is one of the earliest and most rudimentary production processes that human beings developed. Clay was an abundant, easily mined, and intuitive material to begin experimenting with and modelling objects. They used it to build objects and tools to improve their quality of life and be more efficient. Quickly, techniques were created to work with clay, such as modelling, potter\u2019s wheel, molds, extruders, etc., up to one of the most innovative of all, which is 3D printing with clay. Despite having been discovered millions of years ago, it is still a material with great potential and endless possibilities. From the construction of buildings, thanks to their great ability to resist compression, to a decorative vase that is apparently fragile and brittle. This wide range of possibilities gives this material richness and interest that few others can say the same about. In addition, it is a very useful material that creates an experience during its interaction and brings a process of reflection, patience, and introspection. Unfortunately, the pace of life that society and everyday life lead us to does not allow us to enjoy these processes of pause and reflection. Social networks, the search for extreme efficiency, and capitalism\u2026 take us away from crafts and traditions. However, there are still people, to whom we should be grateful, who still work with crafts, keeping their memories and bringing them closer to modernity, with respect and the will to pass on their knowledge to future generations. Catalonia has been a very important centre of ceramics, with several towns with a great reputation for the traditions that have been generated around them, such as Breda, Quart, or La Bisbal d\u2019Empord\u00e0. The abundant clay soil of much of Catalonia has allowed this craft to develop and be one of the main economic engines of many regions. In addition, the climatic conditions favor the entire ceramic process, allowing suitable drying without requiring additional technologies. Ceramics is part of the popular culture of many populations, but there are fewer and fewer ceramists who can continue to work and communicate traditional techniques. In Quart , there are only two potters left who work on ceramics, and it is not because of a lack of work but because young people see more interest in the cities and leave their towns. Therefore, there is a lack of communication about the situation, so a solution would be to promote historical memory with a museum or more pottery training options for new generations. For all this, this project aims to re-evaluate ceramics, with its traditional techniques, and bring it closer to modern society. Combining craftsmanship with innovative production processes and bringing them to the FabLab concept. The duality of craft and technology, digital crafts, local materials and traditions, gamification, local production and international distribution, co-creation, material development, and biomaterial experimentation are some of the intrinsic concepts of the project.
