Each region has its own, and they have developed and evolved over the years. To keep them alive, they must be transmitted from generation to generation, verbally and in writing, so that their existence will be known in the future, but also through community events where specific techniques and knowledge are taught. Craftsmanship has been a major thread of local traditions, but with the advent of industrialization, it has been diminished. Ceramics is one of the earliest and most rudimentary production processes that human beings developed. Clay was an abundant, easily mined, and intuitive material to begin experimenting with and modelling objects. They used it to build objects and tools to improve their quality of life and be more efficient. Quickly, techniques were created to work with clay, such as modelling, potter\u2019s wheel, molds, extruders, etc., up to one of the most innovative of all, which is 3D printing with clay. Despite having been discovered millions of years ago, it is still a material with great potential and endless possibilities. From the construction of buildings, thanks to their great ability to resist compression, to a decorative vase that is apparently fragile and brittle. This wide range of possibilities gives this material richness and interest that few others can say the same about. In addition, it is a very useful material that creates an experience during its interaction and brings a process of reflection, patience, and introspection. Unfortunately, the pace of life that society and everyday life lead us to does not allow us to enjoy these processes of pause and reflection. Social networks, the search for extreme efficiency, and capitalism\u2026 take us away from crafts and traditions. However, there are still people, to whom we should be grateful, who still work with crafts, keeping their memories and bringing them closer to modernity, with respect and the will to pass on their knowledge to future generations. Catalonia has been a very important centre of ceramics, with several towns with a great reputation for the traditions that have been generated around them, such as Breda, Quart, or La Bisbal d\u2019Empord\u00e0. The abundant clay soil of much of Catalonia has allowed this craft to develop and be one of the main economic engines of many regions. In addition, the climatic conditions favor the entire ceramic process, allowing suitable drying without requiring additional technologies. Ceramics is part of the popular culture of many populations, but there are fewer and fewer ceramists who can continue to work and communicate traditional techniques. In Quart , there are only two potters left who work on ceramics, and it is not because of a lack of work but because young people see more interest in the cities and leave their towns. Therefore, there is a lack of communication about the situation, so a solution would be to promote historical memory with a museum or more pottery training options for new generations. For all this, this project aims to re-evaluate ceramics, with its traditional techniques, and bring it closer to modern society. Combining craftsmanship with innovative production processes and bringing them to the FabLab concept. The duality of craft and technology, digital crafts, local materials and traditions, gamification, local production and international distribution, co-creation, material development, and biomaterial experimentation are some of the intrinsic concepts of the project. Self Development \u00b6 Reflexion and introspection about who I am now and who I want to be at the end of the master\u2019s. A mapping of my self-present, what is my identity, what skills I have and my main interests, and the evolution I wish to have of these three sections. In general, I expect to develop myself personally, to be more open to challenges, and especially more self-confident. I used a M\u00f6bius Strip to represent my evolution because this shape seems like a current strip but is made with a single surface and it creates a loop. So, inserting my present and future self into this kind of surface represents that the past, present and future are connected and, in my case, what I want to be in the future, my expectations and my auto-critic vision also define my present self.

Prototyping tests an abstract hypothesis. This type searches for body interaction between the user and the product tested. It also looks for an experience, how the user learns how to interact with it, for what is meant and creates a positive experience. Finally aims to show and experiment with some details of the shape such as textures, colours, shadows, physical conditions, etc. While working on a design project for a chair, I used role 1. Once I had the chair concept, I made a small prototype to see the proportions, the relations between materials, and how the different pieces fit together. This also helped me to test the interaction with the mechanism because I wanted the chair to be adapted to the height of each user. I also looked for gamification concepts to create a playful experience around the chair, so with the first prototype, I could be able to test it and see how it responded. Finally, I was able to extract conclusions about the fixations of the mechanism, so for the final prototype, I could add them. Role 2: The prototype as a means of inquiry \u00b6 The prototype as a means of inquiry where prototypes are developed and deployed as instruments of inquiry to collect, record and measure phenomena. Explore and understand a phenomenon, situation, or experience to get validation for the final users. Capture information, such as material properties or personal behaviour. Also can provoke a specific situation to collect data on the experience and interaction between the user and the design. Instigate a specific reaction to make the users tell you extreme opinions and situations and get ready for future problems. Asks how people will use the final product, making statistics and getting results. Time and costs will determine the prototype. Role 3: The prototype as a research archetype \u00b6 The prototype as a research archetype as embodiments of concepts, understandings or design spaces that can be argued to constitute contributions to the discipline. Research archetype to physicalize a specific concept (create multiple examples). Critical and conceptual designs also follow the third role because help you, as a designer, to understand the possibilities. Understand yourself and know what I am capable of, what you can do with your local environment and how materials we have around shape the product. The third one, I used it in some way while working on a project for Roc Par\u00e9s, an artist who specializes in interactive communication research. He wanted to develop an analog machine, activated with human energy, that creates a relationship between the user and a water drop. He had this concept, so we needed to design the machine, so we started doing some drawings, 3D models, and renders to conceptualize the design. The Water Drop Viewer had the intention of making the user interact with it and create an experience while looking at a drop of water. This piece reflected on the concept of an exhibition \u201cWhat is possible and what is not\u201d . Through the trial and error of the artistic process, it hopes to make users consider the possibilities of art. Role 4: The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry \u00b6 The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry where the process of making an artefact becomes a qualitative instrumental tool in design research. The way you prototype is what matters. The process and the experience of prototyping are the reasons for developing the design and a way to bring new ideas to the table. Participatory design, collective thinking, sharing ideas and techniques, co-design, etc. It also helps the users get immersed in the process of design and allows exploration. This role can be an autobiographical design process where you dialogue with yourself, asking who you are and what you want to achieve. Finally, the documentation of the process is more important than the result. You may write down or film the prototype to preserve your design process in order to be able to replicate it or upgrade it in the future, as well as to share it and make it an open-source project.

A weak signal can be defined as an inflexion point where a problem or a situation can be worked on in the present to become better in the future. Playing and combining weak signals helps to explore new fields while organizing ideas and brainstorming, and is useful for the design process. First of all, I selected different cards randomly to get familiar with them and discover new possible fields for our project. This atlas has different categories. First of all, we have the weak signals, separated into five fields: Design for Anthropocene, Life in the Times of Surveillance Capitalism, Kill the Heteropatriarchy, After the Nation-State, and Life after AI - The End of Work, those are the main areas of action. The other types of card are Random Triggers, Areas of Opportunity and Challenges. Weak Signals in The City \u00b6 We were asked to select one of the cards that interested us for our project and search for an example around the city of Barcelona. I chose Personal Fabrication, a Random Trigger Card that focuses on how in the future the population might have a personal lab to produce their products and be able to repair them when one breaks. People will be the consumers but also the producers of the objects, food, clothes, and all the other necessities in our daily lives. Similar to the kitchens that we have nowadays, we would have a space with new production processes, such as 3D printers, laser machines, CNC cutters, etc. My images are about a problem that I had in my fridge and a simple solution that I found. One of the shelves had a plastic piece that helped store food, but it broke and it was impossible to fix. The fridge doesn\u2019t have to replace pieces and you cannot buy new ones, so the shelf was useless because the food fell with the movement of the door. So I thought that with 3D printing I would be able to make a simple piece to help organize the food and prevent it from falling. First of all, I scanned the shelf with a 3D Scanner App to obtain the perfect dimensions and abstract shapes. Then I was able to make a 3D model of the piece based on the scanned shelf. After that, I 3D printed it, and once finished, I was able to place it in the fridge, and it fit perfectly. This is an example of the potential that digital fabrication, personal fabrication, and the revolution of FabLabs have. The users are going to be the consumers but also the producers, so we would be able to fabricate our products personalized and specifically for our context. With this idea, we can repair objects that we would otherwise throw away, generating much less waste. Atlas of Weak Signals Map \u00b6 I started by selecting some Weak Signals for the creation of the project map. The main ones are Rural Futures and Human-Machine Collaborations, because I am interested in this duality between crafts and technology. Another important card is Long-termism. I believe every design has to be long-lasting in terms of material selection, but also the design has to be atemporal in order to prevent the product from becoming outdated. Starting with the Human-Machine Collaborations we can expand to the Fab Lab world, Digital Fabrication, Open-source, AI, etc. All these topics talk about this shift that society has to make to be able to be more sustainable, auto-sufficient, locally regulated and become more collaborative. I believe in Personal Fabrication for the future. I think Industrial Design will change shortly, and everyone will have their own lab or a nearby one to produce their products, or at least to be able to repair and not throw away when something stops working. I think this idea of community laboratories with innovative facilities can be merged with traditional craftsmanship and local artisan work. Rural areas are becoming uninhabited, and cities are becoming overcrowded. Craftsmen don\u2019t have new generations to transfer their knowledge, techniques, and traditions. Therefore, Rural Futures must be included in the project, searching for new materials but with special consideration to ceramics, because of my connection but also for the long-time traditions that Catalonia has alongside this material. So the main point is to help craftsmen expand their work and to have them again as a reference for good design, and to make design promote the union of society. The intersection between Human-Machine Collaborations and Rural Futures can bring new opportunities for artisans to develop their work. With the combination of traditional techniques and innovative ones, we can generate products more attractive and interesting for future generations, revaluing the traditional processes that are getting forgotten.

I started my day by trying to experiment with clay. I wanted to feel it with all my senses. I went to a ceramic studio, and I mixed clay powder with water to start experimenting. Then I poured the liquid clay into a cast board to make it more controllable. I left the studio with a bag full of clay. Local red clay dirties your hands a lot while working with it. I tried to continue my day always with clay in my hands, looking forward to experiencing different activities thanks to the clay\u2019s interaction with me. I also wanted to see how people would react to me. I walked the streets, playing with the clay in my hands.\u2028 \u2028I also wanted to try eating with my dirty hands. So I had lunch while grabbing clay and interacting with all the objects with clay in between. It was difficult to use the fork, but I liked the experience because the smell of the wet clay changed my perception of the food. After that, I decided to share that experience with other people. So in the evening, I met with some friends, and I asked them to play with clay or plasticine while talking and having a beer. I enjoyed that everyone made something unique and experienced the hangout differently. Some people tried to produce a lot, they wanted to impress others and make something special.\u2028 \u2028 On the other hand, others enjoyed the process, they played with the clay while talking, without searching for a result. I saw one of them evolve his ball of clay, he made a lot of shapes with the same clay and destroyed it every time. Finally, he gave me a weird ball that had no social meaning except for the time he spent with it and the conversations that he had around it.\u2028 \u2028 I decided to bring that analogue and physical experience to the digital world. I selected one of the creations, the weird ball. I 3D scanned it to make a digital copy, document it, and preserve it. The preservation of art and traditions is something so important for culture and society, but we are losing it because the world is evolving fast. I used the EM3D app, which works with infrared, to generate a 3D model of the clay ball. After that, I prepared the file for 3D printing with Cura, and I tried to print it with the same characteristics. The result was brilliant, both shapes looked similar. I find this process so interesting because it permits every person to model something in 3D. You don\u2019t need to learn 3D digital software, only with your hands and by experiencing the physical sensations of the clay can you generate something unique and then import it into the digital world. Reflection \u00b6 From that experience, I can draw some conclusions. Introducing the clay to the bar table made everyone participate in the same action, and thanks to that, a lot of conversations were generated. We talked about crafts and traditions. We generated objects from a social experience that reminded me of a moment. With 3D scanning and printing, I can generate copies of and preserve a shape that, given some time, would be destroyed. The connection between the physical and digital, and the traditions and innovation are hybrid concepts that really interest me. Another exploration concept is the time of creation that needs a human person and the time that uses a machine to try to create a similar shape. The time spent by my friend creating the shape was about an hour, he experienced the clay and used that process to share his experience and talk and interact with others. Comparing it with the 3D printer, bypassing the time I spent 3D scanning and slicing the file, it was 1 hour and 22 minutes. So the time of fabrication is similar, but, indeed, machines cannot create, they only follow human indications. At least for now, who knows how AI would evolve in the future? Can machines create culture and traditions?","title":"Living with your own Ideas"},{"location":"Term1/03-Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"","title":"Living with your own Ideas"},{"location":"Term1/03-Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#make-a-companion","text":"","title":"Make a Companion"},{"location":"Term1/03-Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#creation-and-expectations","text":"Ecology: Reflect about saving water Capitalism: The need to have it all Minimalist lifestyle \u2014 eliminate what is not essential Minimalism is an antidote to that state of overload \u2014 back to rural places Bottle that makes you suffer during a day to realize all necessary things and the not essential ones.","title":"Creation and expectations"},{"location":"Term1/03-Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#living-with-it-24-hours","text":"Living together for 24 hours How I lived together? \u2014 tried to drink from it (stupid/useless) \u2014 I had to search other ways to get water What does it notice? \u2014 tried to drink so much times, I realized how much I need water to continue with my life \u2014 I usually drink very little water Why does it matter? \u2014 suffer, feeling humiliated (introspection) \u2014 essential and not essential","title":"Living with it 24 hours"},{"location":"Term1/03-Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#1pp-exploration","text":"","title":"1PP Exploration"},{"location":"Term1/03-Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#experience","text":"How would it be to share a craft experience in the physical world and import it into the digital?

Contextualization \u00b6 In Spain, there are many cases of sexual aggression, generally from men towards women. It is a problem that needs to be solved because many women feel their freedom restricted and in many cases suffer physical or psychological aggressions. There are many types of aggression, and therefore it is difficult to discriminate them by type, but with this project we seek to detect all types of sexist aggression, from a passing glance to a prick. An INE report reveals that in 2021, 3196 sentences were imposed for crimes against sexual freedom and that 97.9% of the aggressors were male. Objectives \u00b6 Goals: The goal of this machine is to detect sexist behavior and remove aggressors from the club so that people can feel free and enjoy the full club experience. These detections are at different levels, such as gestures, glances, touching, expressions or syringe pricks. On the other hand, this machine wants to show everyone whenever aggression is happening, so club users are aware of the high amount of sexism in our society. This system believes in the education model of awareness rather than punishment. Whenever aggression is detected, the song playing in the club changes, so everyone is warned and annoyed. Types of Smart Tasks: The tasks that the machine should be able to do to achieve perfect detection of sexist behaviors are, in the first hand, gesture analysis. This means scanning bodies and establishing relationships between them in order to determine when one of them is invading an individual\u2019s privacy. The next one is face recognition, which scans faces and facial expressions to analyze eyes and lips. Finally, microphones register sounds and conversations to let us know if someone is harassing another person. Dataset Format \u00b6 The technology used for the correct functioning of the machine is based on \u201cmachine learning\u201d. In machine learning, algorithms are trained to find patterns and correlations in large data sets and to make the best decisions and forecasts based on that analysis. Machine learning applications improve with use and become more accurate as they have access to more data. The dataset programmed in the machine will allow the machine to be trained to correctly detect when there is sexist abuse in the clubs. The machine will learn based on questions like: \u201cIs that a machism language?, Is that physical behavior sexist? , etc. If the machine detects something that is wrong, the next time the same situation occurs it will know that it is not a sexist abuse and so on continuously with different situations that it captures. Colab and Dataset used \u00b6 First of all, we were looking for datasets to recognize offensive language. Hate speech and offensive language dataset. Sexist workplace statements Both are an excel spreadsheet where each column is an offensive phrase or word. It was collected from tweets via keywords and hashtags. Colab: Motion Detector The Colab tool has been used to execute Phyton codes to detect movements within clubs. Library name: Alphapose Limitations & opportunities \u00b6 Some limitations of our machine: Recognizing the sounds and conversations in detail is very complex and difficult, especially in crowded clubs because of music and the high volume of voices. In an unlit context, physical recognition could be hard and confusing. Also there should be a lot of cameras or sensors to detect every angle of the club, even if it\u2019s crowded and people cover themselves. Also, the large number of people in the clubs could make it difficult for the machine to control at the same time a lot of situations and possible sexist behaviors. People could feel that their privacy is invaded and that this system is trying to control them. Ethical issues associated with the machine. Should club users sign a contract for the cession of image privacy? Some opportunities to improve it: Additional sensors in some body parts (wrists, ankles) of the users, as bracelets to help the cameras detect precise movements. The machine should incorporate several cameras in order to have different perspectives for image recognition. Night vision cameras or infrared sensors to detect better physical gestures. Make everyone sign a contract to agree on the terms. For ethical issues, only the users who want to be detected by the machine will be given the bracelets.","title":"Extended Intelligences"},{"location":"Term1/06-Extended%20Intelligences/#extended-intelligences","text":"","title":"Extended Intelligences"},{"location":"Term1/06-Extended%20Intelligences/#ai-and-machine-intelligence","text":"A course about Artificial Intelligence and its potential.

Each region has its own, and they have developed and evolved over the years. To keep them alive, they must be transmitted from generation to generation, verbally and in writing, so that their existence will be known in the future, but also through community events where specific techniques and knowledge are taught. Craftsmanship has been a major thread of local traditions, but with the advent of industrialization, it has been diminished. Ceramics is one of the earliest and most rudimentary production processes that human beings developed. Clay was an abundant, easily mined, and intuitive material to begin experimenting with and modelling objects. They used it to build objects and tools to improve their quality of life and be more efficient. Quickly, techniques were created to work with clay, such as modelling, potter\u2019s wheel, molds, extruders, etc., up to one of the most innovative of all, which is 3D printing with clay. Despite having been discovered millions of years ago, it is still a material with great potential and endless possibilities. From the construction of buildings, thanks to their great ability to resist compression, to a decorative vase that is apparently fragile and brittle. This wide range of possibilities gives this material richness and interest that few others can say the same about. In addition, it is a very useful material that creates an experience during its interaction and brings a process of reflection, patience, and introspection. Unfortunately, the pace of life that society and everyday life lead us to does not allow us to enjoy these processes of pause and reflection. Social networks, the search for extreme efficiency, and capitalism\u2026 take us away from crafts and traditions. However, there are still people, to whom we should be grateful, who still work with crafts, keeping their memories and bringing them closer to modernity, with respect and the will to pass on their knowledge to future generations. Catalonia has been a very important centre of ceramics, with several towns with a great reputation for the traditions that have been generated around them, such as Breda, Quart, or La Bisbal d\u2019Empord\u00e0. The abundant clay soil of much of Catalonia has allowed this craft to develop and be one of the main economic engines of many regions. In addition, the climatic conditions favor the entire ceramic process, allowing suitable drying without requiring additional technologies. Ceramics is part of the popular culture of many populations, but there are fewer and fewer ceramists who can continue to work and communicate traditional techniques. In Quart , there are only two potters left who work on ceramics, and it is not because of a lack of work but because young people see more interest in the cities and leave their towns. Therefore, there is a lack of communication about the situation, so a solution would be to promote historical memory with a museum or more pottery training options for new generations. For all this, this project aims to re-evaluate ceramics, with its traditional techniques, and bring it closer to modern society. Combining craftsmanship with innovative production processes and bringing them to the FabLab concept. The duality of craft and technology, digital crafts, local materials and traditions, gamification, local production and international distribution, co-creation, material development, and biomaterial experimentation are some of the intrinsic concepts of the project. Questioning How is there a boom in ceramics in Barcelona, while at the same time traditional ceramists are losing their heritage?","title":"Initial ideas"},{"location":"project/project/#initial-ideas","text":"Traditions have always been of great value to society and have created great cultural wealth.

Social networks, the search for extreme efficiency, and capitalism\u2026 take us away from crafts and traditions. However, there are still people, to whom we should be grateful, who still work with crafts, keeping their memories and bringing them closer to modernity, with respect and the will to pass on their knowledge to future generations. Catalonia has been a very important centre of ceramics, with several towns with a great reputation for the traditions that have been generated around them, such as Breda, Quart, or La Bisbal d\u2019Empord\u00e0. The abundant clay soil of much of Catalonia has allowed this craft to develop and be one of the main economic engines of many regions. In addition, the climatic conditions favor the entire ceramic process, allowing suitable drying without requiring additional technologies. Ceramics is part of the popular culture of many populations, but there are fewer and fewer ceramists who can continue to work and communicate traditional techniques. In Quart , there are only two potters left who work on ceramics, and it is not because of a lack of work but because young people see more interest in the cities and leave their towns. Therefore, there is a lack of communication about the situation, so a solution would be to promote historical memory with a museum or more pottery training options for new generations. For all this, this project aims to re-evaluate ceramics, with its traditional techniques, and bring it closer to modern society. Combining craftsmanship with innovative production processes and bringing them to the FabLab concept. The duality of craft and technology, digital crafts, local materials and traditions, gamification, local production and international distribution, co-creation, material development, and biomaterial experimentation are some of the intrinsic concepts of the project.
