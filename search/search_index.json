Each region has its own, and they have developed and evolved over the years. To keep them alive, they must be transmitted from generation to generation, verbally and in writing, so that their existence will be known in the future, but also through community events where specific techniques and knowledge are taught. Craftsmanship has been a major thread of local traditions, but with the advent of industrialization, it has been diminished. Ceramics is one of the earliest and most rudimentary production processes that human beings developed. Clay was an abundant, easily mined, and intuitive material to begin experimenting with and modelling objects. They used it to build objects and tools to improve their quality of life and be more efficient. Quickly, techniques were created to work with clay, such as modelling, potter\u2019s wheel, molds, extruders, etc., up to one of the most innovative of all, which is 3D printing with clay. Despite having been discovered millions of years ago, it is still a material with great potential and endless possibilities. From the construction of buildings, thanks to their great ability to resist compression, to a decorative vase that is apparently fragile and brittle. This wide range of possibilities gives this material richness and interest that few others can say the same about. In addition, it is a very useful material that creates an experience during its interaction and brings a process of reflection, patience, and introspection. Unfortunately, the pace of life that society and everyday life lead us to does not allow us to enjoy these processes of pause and reflection. Social networks, the search for extreme efficiency, and capitalism\u2026 take us away from crafts and traditions. However, there are still people, to whom we should be grateful, who still work with crafts, keeping their memories and bringing them closer to modernity, with respect and the will to pass on their knowledge to future generations. Catalonia has been a very important centre of ceramics, with several towns with a great reputation for the traditions that have been generated around them, such as Breda, Quart, or La Bisbal d\u2019Empord\u00e0. The abundant clay soil of much of Catalonia has allowed this craft to develop and be one of the main economic engines of many regions. In addition, the climatic conditions favor the entire ceramic process, allowing suitable drying without requiring additional technologies. Ceramics is part of the popular culture of many populations, but there are fewer and fewer ceramists who can continue to work and communicate traditional techniques. In Quart , there are only two potters left who work on ceramics, and it is not because of a lack of work but because young people see more interest in the cities and leave their towns. Therefore, there is a lack of communication about the situation, so a solution would be to promote historical memory with a museum or more pottery training options for new generations. For all this, this project aims to re-evaluate ceramics, with its traditional techniques, and bring it closer to modern society. Combining craftsmanship with innovative production processes and bringing them to the FabLab concept. The duality of craft and technology, digital crafts, local materials and traditions, gamification, local production and international distribution, co-creation, material development, and biomaterial experimentation are some of the intrinsic concepts of the project. Self Development Reflexion and introspection about who I am now and who I want to be at the end of the master\u2019s. A mapping of my self-present, what is my identity, what skills I have and my main interests, and the evolution I wish to have of these three sections. In general, I expect to develop myself personally, to be more open to challenges, and especially more self-confident. I used a M\u00f6bius Strip to represent my evolution because this shape seems like a current strip but is made with a single surface and it creates a loop. So, inserting my present and future self into this kind of surface represents that the past, present and future are connected and, in my case, what I want to be in the future, my expectations and my auto-critic vision also define my present self.

A weak signal can be defined as an inflexion point where a problem or a situation can be worked on in the present to become better in the future. Playing and combining weak signals helps to explore new fields while organizing ideas and brainstorming, and is useful for the design process. First of all, I selected different cards randomly to get familiar with them and discover new possible fields for our project. This atlas has different categories. First of all, we have the weak signals, separated into five fields: Design for Anthropocene, Life in the Times of Surveillance Capitalism, Kill the Heteropatriarchy, After the Nation-State, and Life after AI - The End of Work, those are the main areas of action. The other types of card are Random Triggers, Areas of Opportunity and Challenges. We were asked to select one of the cards that interested us for our project and search for an example around the city of Barcelona. I chose Personal Fabrication, a Random Trigger Card that focuses on how in the future the population might have a personal lab to produce their products and be able to repair them when one breaks. People will be the consumers but also the producers of the objects, food, clothes, and all the other necessities in our daily lives. Similar to the kitchens that we have nowadays, we would have a space with new production processes, such as 3D printers, laser machines, CNC cutters, etc. My images are about a problem that I had in my fridge and a simple solution that I found. One of the shelves had a plastic piece that helped store food, but it broke and it was impossible to fix. The fridge doesn\u2019t have to replace pieces and you cannot buy new ones, so the shelf was useless because the food fell with the movement of the door. So I thought that with 3D printing I would be able to make a simple piece to help organize the food and prevent it from falling. First of all, I scanned the shelf with a 3D Scanner App to obtain the perfect dimensions and abstract shapes. Then I was able to make a 3D model of the piece based on the scanned shelf. After that, I 3D printed it, and once finished, I was able to place it in the fridge, and it fit perfectly. This is an example of the potential that digital fabrication, personal fabrication, and the revolution of FabLabs have. The users are going to be the consumers but also the producers, so we would be able to fabricate our products personalized and specifically for our context. With this idea, we can repair objects that we would otherwise throw away, generating much less waste. I started by selecting some Weak Signals for the creation of the project map. The main ones are Rural Futures and Human-Machine Collaborations, because I am interested in this duality between crafts and technology. Another important card is Long-termism. I believe every design has to be long-lasting in terms of material selection, but also the design has to be atemporal in order to prevent the product from becoming outdated. Starting with the Human-Machine Collaborations we can expand to the Fab Lab world, Digital Fabrication, Open-source, AI, etc. All these topics talk about this shift that society has to make to be able to be more sustainable, auto-sufficient, locally regulated and become more collaborative. I believe in Personal Fabrication for the future. I think Industrial Design will change shortly, and everyone will have their own lab or a nearby one to produce their products, or at least to be able to repair and not throw away when something stops working. I think this idea of community laboratories with innovative facilities can be merged with traditional craftsmanship and local artisan work. Rural areas are becoming uninhabited, and cities are becoming overcrowded. Craftsmen don\u2019t have new generations to transfer their knowledge, techniques, and traditions. Therefore, Rural Futures must be included in the project, searching for new materials but with special consideration to ceramics, because of my connection but also for the long-time traditions that Catalonia has alongside this material. So the main point is to help craftsmen expand their work and to have them again as a reference for good design, and to make design promote the union of society. The intersection between Human-Machine Collaborations and Rural Futures can bring new opportunities for artisans to develop their work. With the combination of traditional techniques and innovative ones, we can generate products more attractive and interesting for future generations, revaluing the traditional processes that are getting forgotten.
