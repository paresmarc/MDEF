# Final Project

## Exploring the Intersection of Traditional Ceramics and Modern Technologies

This master's project delves into the convergence of traditional ceramics and modern technologies, with the objective of bridging the gap between rich ceramic heritage and contemporary design approaches. Through extensive research and engagement with traditional artisans, the project identifies challenges faced by craftsmen and their adaptability in response to changing times.

The project encompasses multiple key areas: traditional ceramics and heritage, digital crafts and 3D printing, the maker movement and accessibility, participatory design processes and collaborations, scalability and replicability, digital platforms for accessibility, and sustainability and the preservation of traditions.

Drawing inspiration from the slow-paced rural environment of Catalonia, particularly La Bisbal, and with a personal connection to its traditional ceramics, the project aims to revive customary practices by leveraging new fabrication tools like 3D printing and AI models. The goal is to create contemporary interpretations that honor cultural heritage.

A significant aspect of the project explores the allure of AI-driven interactions in comparison to traditional museum experiences. In today's digital era, individuals seek interactive and personalized encounters. By integrating AI technologies into ceramics, captivating experiences are envisioned that merge the physical beauty of ceramics with the intrigue of AI.

Ultimately, the project aims to rekindle interest in ceramics and traditional crafts, making them more accessible and relevant to younger generations. Through engagement with rural communities, embracing a slow craftsmanship approach, and utilizing modern technologies, the intention is to foster renewed appreciation for ceramics. Interdisciplinary collaboration, sustainability endeavors, and the preservation of cultural traditions play vital roles in establishing meaningful connections between the past and present.

In summary, this master's project explores the intersection of traditional ceramics and modern technologies. By honoring ceramic heritage and integrating it with innovative approaches, the project seeks to revitalize the craft, bridge generational gaps, and preserve cultural traditions. Through research, collaboration, and a focus on sustainability, the project endeavors to create a lasting impact in the field of ceramics.

## Final Design space

I developed my design space as it was growing, making every new piece of content a little bigger than the previous one, ending with a kind of conical evolution where the initial exploration seems far away.

## Alternative Presents

I am delving into the world of ceramics, where I aim to create a meaningful impact and bring about change. The context in which I am working is one where people are increasingly seeking mindfulness and personal rejuvenation through ceramics. However, I believe there is more to ceramics than just a self-centered experience, and I am designing a system that challenges this notion.

Alternative Present:
Blending Tradition with Modern Technology My goal is to revive old crafting techniques and items by blending them with modern technology, appealing to younger generations and emphasizing the value of handcrafted products. I am committed to promoting transparency in the production process, adopting an opensource approach.

A significant aspect of my project would involve recovering ceramic pieces lost during the Spanish Civil War and subsequent repression. I am particularly focused on the work of Marian Burgu√®s, a renowned ceramicist who is also my great-grandfather. By searching for these lost pieces and utilizing new technologies, such as 3D printing, AI, and 3D scanning, I aim to recreate and reinterpret them in contemporary ways.

Another key aspect of my project is preserving and transmitting local traditions, as well as shedding light on lesser-known ceramicists. I believe that establishing a personal connection with these traditions is essential to inspire others to value and revive them. Through the integration of
innovative technologies, I aim to make the project more engaging and attractive to new generations.
One intriguing idea I am currently exploring is using AI to create reinterpretations of preserved ceramic pieces, incorporating elements from the past into new designs. This involves careful consideration of how to train AI models using historical concepts. By fusing the past with futuristic tools, I hope to revive and reinterpret traditional ceramics in a novel and compelling manner.

**Traditional pieces updated with AI?**

I started working on an AI model named Text 2 Mesh that modifies 3D models through text Prompts. It was challenging to use this model because some codes were outdated but at the end, I managed to use it and some outputs were impressive. It remains some work to correctly define some variables to have more control on the outputs. After having the modified models of the traditional pieces, the idea would be to 3D print them with clay machines and reflect on the differences between the original one and the AI one.

Working on this thesis project has been an exhilarating journey, combining elements of tradition, technology, local traditions, and lost ceramics. The prospect of bridging the gap between the past and the present through critical thinking and the application of AI is both unique and captivating. I am eagerly looking forward to the future and the possibilities this project holds, as it unfolds in ways that inspire and challenge me.
