## Reflection

The seminar on decentralized networks introduced the technical advancements in Web 3.0, exploring the underlying technologies that enable Web 2.0 functionalities. It was an eye-opening experience to delve into the blockchain paradigm and NFT technology, witnessing how artists and art projects are pushing the boundaries of creativity through these innovative tools.

Within the digital realm, the concept of art takes on a whole new dimension, presenting a unique and thought-provoking landscape to navigate. People's adaptability to these new paradigms is remarkable, as they embrace the fusion of art and technology in exciting ways.

During the seminar, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in the creation and trading of NFTs, which sparked a deep curiosity within me. However, I couldn't help but feel a slight longing for more practical engagement with blockchain programming, as it would have enriched my understanding of the underlying mechanisms further.

Interestingly, the seminar's title, "collective intelligence," seemed somewhat disconnected from the topics covered. While the exploration of blockchain and the web shed light on collective intelligence, it is important to recognize that there are various avenues through which this concept can be realized, extending beyond the realms of blockchain and the digital world.

Motivated by the seminar, I embarked on the creation of an NFT that aimed to challenge conventional notions of ownership and societal standards of beauty. By deliberately provoking confusion and introspection in users, I intended to encourage a deeper reflection on the true meaning behind acquiring NFTs and the significance of the art they represent.

Supporting artists in the digital arts realm through NFTs or other mediums is undeniably valuable. However, it is crucial to approach this space with caution and avoid becoming solely fixated on the monetary aspect. The influence of the market on art creation and the potential manipulation of behaviors should be critically examined and navigated with care.

In summary, the seminar provided an invigorating exploration of the ever-evolving field of digital arts. While embracing the exciting possibilities brought forth by technology, it is essential to maintain a delicate balance between commercialization and preserving the integrity of artistic expression. The intersection of art and technology holds immense potential, and it is through thoughtful consideration that we can fully embrace the transformative power of this fusion.
