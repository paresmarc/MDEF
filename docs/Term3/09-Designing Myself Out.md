# Designing Myself Out

This master it’s been an evolution for me, researching around the same topics but trying to absorb everything I was interacting with to implement it in my work. After this process I can say I know better what I want to continue exploring and how I can do my next steps.

My main topic through the master it’s been the traditional ceramics in local context. I met lots of people that works in traditional crafts or at least tries to do it because every day is more difficult. Even so I found people that could change the perspective and modify a little their process to be able to continue working with what passionate them.

About my project, I want to keep exploring about traditional practices as ceramics, as well as new fabrication tools. I am interested in bridging these two worlds and learn from each one.

Here are some main fields that I want to be part of my journey:

1. Ceramics and traditions: I recognize the significance of ceramics and traditional craftsmanship as a foundation for my project. I aim to bridge the gap between traditional practices and modern technologies, exploring innovative approaches while honoring the rich heritage of ceramics.

2. Digital crafts and 3D printing: I am excited about integrating digital crafts and 3D printing into my ceramic production processes. This integration opens up new possibilities for design, customization, and scalability, allowing me to create unique and personalized ceramic pieces.

3. Maker movement and accessibility: I believe in the power of the maker movement to promote accessibility in ceramics and digital crafts. By actively involving individuals and communities in the creative process, I aim to empower people and create an inclusive environment for everyone to participate in ceramic making.

4. Participative Design Process and collaborations: I embrace the concept of Participative Design Process and seek opportunities to collaborate with other experts in the field. Whether it's partnering with traditional ceramists, digital artists, makerspaces, or educational institutions, I value the exchange of knowledge and expertise to enhance my project.

5. Scalability and replicability: As I work on my project, scalability and replicability are important considerations. I want to develop methods that can be applied to different scales, from individual projects to larger events or productions. This ensures that my approach can be adapted and implemented in various contexts.

6. Accessibility through digital platforms: I recognize the value of digital platforms in making ceramics and digital crafts accessible. Through websites and social media, I can share resources, tutorials, and information about my project. This way, people from different locations and backgrounds can access the knowledge and tools I provide.

7. Sustainability and preservation of traditions: I am committed to sustainability and the preservation of traditional ceramic practices. I strive to explore environmentally friendly production techniques, promote cultural heritage, and engage with local communities. By doing so, I ensure the continuity of ceramic traditions and contribute to a more sustainable future.

In conclusion, the combination of these points provides a solid foundation for my project. I am particularly passionate about traditional ceramics in Catalonia, especially in La Bisbal, where I have a personal connection. The slow pace and rural atmosphere of these areas inspire me to create meaningful work that reflects the local community.

My main goal is to bring together traditional ceramics and modern technologies, like AI models. By using these advanced tools, I could enhance the creative process, expand the possibilities of ceramic design, and preserve Catalonia's cultural heritage. This fusion allows me to combine the wisdom of traditional techniques with the cutting-edge capabilities of artificial intelligence, resulting in unique and innovative ceramic pieces.

I also find it interesting to explore why more people seem to be engaged with AI rather than museums. In today's fast-paced digital world, people are increasingly drawn to interactive and personalized experiences, which AI can provide. However, I still believe museums play an important role as guardians of culture and history. By integrating traditional ceramics with modern technologies, I hope to create captivating experiences that bridge the gap between the physical beauty of ceramics and the attraction of AI driven interactions.

Ultimately, my project aims to reignite interest in ceramics and traditional crafts by presenting them in a contemporary and accessible way. By connecting with rural communities, embracing the slow craftsmanship approach, and leveraging modern technologies, I hope to create a dialogue between the past and the present. Through this interdisciplinary approach, I aspire to foster a renewed appreciation for ceramics and inspire a new generation to cherish the beauty and cultural significance of this timeless craft.
