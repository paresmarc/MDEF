# Design Ethics

## Reflection

The Design Ethics seminar provided a comprehensive overview of the relationship between technology, ethics, and design. It challenged me to think critically about the complex issues surrounding the development and use of technology, and to reflect on the potential ethical implications of design. Through engaging with the material and participating in discussions, I gained a deeper understanding of the philosophical foundations of technology and its relationship with humans, and developed my own ethical framework for approaching technology and design. Overall, the seminar was an insightful and thought-provoking experience that broadened my perspective and enhanced my understanding of the importance of ethics in design.

# Transfeminist Design

## Reflection

Attending the seminar provided a thought-provoking exploration of various topics that intersected art, design, research, and critical practices. Throughout the sessions, we delved into critical examinations of terms, narratives, and discourses, questioning their historical usage and current implications. These discussions prompted a deeper understanding of the power dynamics at play, where negative, restrictive power operates alongside affirmative, empowering power in politics, knowledge, and knowledge transfer.

One significant theme that emerged during the seminar was the exploration of fiction as a critical tool. We engaged in thought-provoking discussions about how fiction shapes our ideas about the future and can serve as a vehicle for critique. It was intriguing to contemplate the hyper-real consequences of fiction, particularly in relation to the impact of fictional boundaries. These imagined divisions can have real-world repercussions, leading to environmental, political, and social conflicts with devastating effects.

A crucial aspect of the seminar involved examining colonial backgrounds and the presence of racism within systems and structures. We delved into the unsettling historical and philosophical theories that have been used to justify harmful actions in the name of the "moral good." These discussions forced us to confront uncomfortable truths and critically analyze the implications of these ideologies in our contemporary world. Another highlight of the seminar was the introduction to Indigenous feminism and radical Indigenous survivance. These powerful counter-narratives challenged the colonial backgrounds and power structures that continue to perpetuate inequality. It was inspiring to explore how these perspectives disrupt oppressive systems and offer alternative ways of understanding and engaging with the world.

The seminar provided valuable insights into the concept of biohacking and its implications for control over our bodies. The exploration of projects such as "Open Source Hormones" sparked discussions about the influence of hormones and the future of medicine. We were prompted to question who has control over our bodies and the ethical considerations surrounding biohacking practices.

Throughout the seminar we talked about art, science, and technology projects that challenge the status quo. The Aqua_Forensic project, which visualizes invisible anthropogenic pollutants in water habitats, exemplified how interdisciplinary approaches can bring awareness to environmental issues. The discussions in the seminar prompted self-reflection and highlighted the significance of understanding the power dynamics and epistemic violence that threaten the integrity of individuals and communities.

Attending this seminar was a transformative experience, expanding my knowledge and challenging my perspectives. The diverse range of topics covered, from critical practices to colonial backgrounds, power dynamics, and biohacking, provided a comprehensive and thought-provoking exploration of the intersections between art, design, science, and critical inquiry. It has inspired me to further explore these subjects and continue engaging in interdisciplinary approaches that challenge the status quo and promote positive change in society.
