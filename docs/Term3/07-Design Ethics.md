# Design Ethics

## Reflection

The Design Ethics seminar provided a comprehensive overview of the relationship between technology, ethics, and design. It challenged me to think critically about the complex issues surrounding the development and use of technology, and to reflect on the potential ethical implications of design. Through engaging with the material and participating in discussions, I gained a deeper understanding of the philosophical foundations of technology and its relationship with humans, and developed my own ethical framework for approaching technology and design. Overall, the seminar was an insightful and thought-provoking experience that broadened my perspective and enhanced my understanding of the importance of ethics in design.
