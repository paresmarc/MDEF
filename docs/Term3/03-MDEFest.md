This seminars focused on planning and organizing the festival for MDEF. Throughout the seminars, we explored different event formats, approaches, and audiences. I found this useful because it allowed us to consider a wide range of possibilities when it came to designing the festival.

## Reflection

One of the key takeaways from the seminars was the importance of defining the general theme and sub-themes of the festival. This helped us to create a cohesive and consistent experience for attendees. We also worked together to come up with a festival title that accurately reflected our topics.

Another aspect that we covered in the seminars was exploring and mapping places, communities, and stakeholders. This allowed us to identify potential venues, audiences, and partners for the festival. It was interesting to see how much thought and consideration went into identifying the different stakeholders and how they could contribute to the festival's success.

As we continued to work together, we identified the different working groups and events that would make up the festival. This involved finding connections between the different working groups and their events to create a cohesive program. We also had to define the formats, audiences, and collaborators of each event, which was a challenging but engaging process.

Finally, we discussed the overall agenda and approaches to communication and outreach. This included determining the different channels we would use to promote the festival and reach out to potential attendees. It was important to consider how we would communicate the festival's theme and sub-themes in a way that would resonate with the target audience.

Overall, the seminars provided me with a lot of valuable insights into the process of planning and organizing a festival. I learned that it takes a lot of teamwork, communication, and careful consideration to create an event that is both engaging and impactful.
