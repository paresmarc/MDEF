# Robots

This seminar on robots was a very enlightening experience. The seminar covered several topics such as robotic manufacturing, tools, and lab procedures. I was particularly engaged by the section on controlling a robot manually to learn about the axis and movement.

## Reflection

During this session, we had the opportunity to interact with a real robot and control its movements manually. It was quite an interesting experience as we had to learn how to manipulate the various axis and controls to make the robot move in different directions. Through this exercise, I learned that robotic control requires a great deal of skill and precision, and it is essential to have a thorough understanding of the robot's movement capabilities.

Another highlight of the seminar was the session on creating the G-code file with Grasshopper to make the robot move autonomously and create something. This session was particularly exciting as it demonstrated how robots can be programmed to perform specific tasks without human intervention. We learned how to use Grasshopper to generate the code necessary for the robot to move autonomously.

Overall, the seminar was a great learning experience, and I came away with a greater appreciation for the potential of robotics in manufacturing and other industries. I learned that with the right tools and procedures, robots can perform tasks with speed, precision, and consistency, making them valuable assets in many fields. I also realized that robotics requires a unique set of skills and expertise, and I am excited to continue learning more about this field.
