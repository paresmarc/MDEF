# Distributed Design

## Reflection Class I

The seminar presented an overview of Distributed Design and the evolution of the Distributed Design Platform (DDP). The presentation began by highlighting the importance of measuring impact in the field of Distributed Design, which is crucial for evaluating the success of a project and making informed decisions for future endeavors.

The seminar also introduced the DDP values, which are the guiding principles for the platform's operations. These values include collaboration, community, diversity, and sustainability, all of which are essential for ensuring that projects are inclusive, equitable, and environmentally responsible.

Furthermore, the seminar provided an overview of the DDP members, resources, and opportunity tracks available to students interested in pursuing Distributed Design. This information is crucial for students who wish to get involved in the field and connect with other professionals.

Overall, the seminar was informative and engaging, providing an excellent introduction to the field of Distributed Design and the DDP. The presentation successfully conveyed the importance of measuring impact, as well as the platform's values and resources, encouraging students to pursue opportunities in Distributed Design.

**Learning Skills:**
During the seminar, I was able to develop my critical thinking skills by engaging with the essential topics related to the field of Distributed Design. As the seminar was conducted in English, it allowed me to practice my language skills and express my thoughts more detailed. Also, by talking and developing a fluid reasoning, I was able to understand the evolution of the DDP more thoroughly.

**Dynamics:**
The seminar's dynamic was well-balanced and allowed everyone to contribute to the discussion. While some students took a leading role, I felt comfortable contributing my opinions and ideas, which made me feel more involved and invested in the topic.

**Interactions:**
During the seminar, I was passive at times, but I still contributed my ideas and thoughts whenever possible. The atmosphere was welcoming, and I felt like my opinion was respected and valued regardless of my role in the seminar. Importantly, my opinion was not influenced by my role, which made me feel more confident in expressing myself.

## Tree Model

Applying the Reflection Tree model to my project was a really insightful experience. I designed a system that recovers traditional ceramic pieces that got lost in a reinterpretated piece made with AI and new technologies. As I went through the Reflection Tree, I was able to evaluate how my project aligns with the Distributed Design Platform values and the impact I'm already creating.

I found that my project scored high in some areas, like being open and having an ecosystemic approach, but there were also areas where I could improve, such as collaborating more and regenerating environmentally. It was encouraging to see that my project was in alignment with some of the key values of Distributed Design, but it also highlighted areas where I need to focus my attention to improve the impact of my project in the short, mid- and long-term.

Overall, I found the Reflection Tree to be a helpful tool for evaluating my project and identifying areas for improvement. It helped me to better understand the impact of my project in relation to Distributed Design values and provided a roadmap for how I can continue to make progress. The playful attitude encouraged in the Reflection Tree also helped me to approach the evaluation process without feeling too much pressure to achieve perfect scores. I recommend this model to anyone who wants to evaluate their project's values and improve their impact.
