# Kick off - Framing first Design Intervention for Term III

## Interventions

### Screen-printing Workshop

With this intervention we tested our Pattern Design prototype and we explored the potential and the multiple applications. We started by organizing a Screen-printing workshop because it is an easy process where we can apply our design to create different patterns to print on clothes, bags, notebooks…

We wanted a space where to do the workshop, meet new people interested in the same topics and collaborate sharing knowledge. We collaborated with “Caixa d’Eines i Feines”, a space where they teach free workshops and help citizens in multiple aspects, always keeping an eye on sustainability.

**1st Workshop — Caixa d’Eines i Feines x Taller de Costura**

Then, we did a collaboration with the sewing workshop also in Caixa d’Eines i Feines to test the process and have the first feedback to be able to improve the design and the experience.

This first iteration went really well, we enjoyed the experience and we could get some feedback to improve the process for the next one. It was a nice activity where we found that the prototype was interesting but needed some changes to make it more intuitive and have the output shape faster.

We tested the prototype to design patterns to be screen printed on clothes, bags, notebooks… First of all the user have to place the simple shapes in the grid, however they want, creating a shape that after could create a big pattern. Once they are happy with the design, the system with a camera detects the shapes and digitalizes it, creating vectors. With this file you can export it to create multiple things, for this workshop we exported as svg to be cutted with the vinyl cutter and create stencils. Finally, placing the stencil in a silkscreen frame, multiple prints can be made on any type of surface.

**2nd Workshop — Caixa d’Eines i Feines Anniversary**

For the second iteration we took advantage of the 2nd anniversary of Caixa d’Eines i Feines to plan a workshop during the celebration, so we could have more attendees. We repeated with the Screen Printing because it is a simple process where the users can easily understand the application of the prototype and evaluate its potential.

We started the workshop explaining the main purpose and giving information about the equipment and process. We split up into tasks some of us helping the participants through the design process using the physical kit to design the patterns, while others took care of the digitalization and vinyl cutting and stencil transfer for screen printing.

We borrowed a vinyl cutter and used it to cut the designs on the vinyl. Then we transferred the stencils onto frames using transfer tape. Participants helped us during this process, gaining hands-on experience and feeling more confident. Participants showed enthusiasm during the screen-printing step. Some participants were interested in using the kit technology in their own creative spaces.

*Vinyl cutting and stencil.*

We really enjoyed the workshop. The prototype still had some things to improve because the detection system wasn’t working as precise as we wanted but the participants could make their own design with the physical pieces and see the instant digitalization of it. During the design process, participants gave us valuable feedback. Since the grid had magnets, participants couldn't freely place items, which caused some confusion. But we explained that the Grasshopper detects shapes using the magnets in each square's center.

Even so, came up a lot of pretty and unique designs. As we collaborated with Caixa d’Eines there was a lot of people that got interested in our work and wanted to participate. But also, as we did it in a public park the people passing by wanted to know what we were doing and joined the workshop. A group of urban sketchers got really engaged and they screen-printed their notebooks.

*Space, attendees and environment.*

In conclusion, the second screen printing workshop was valuable for interacting with different people and getting feedback to improve our prototype and process. It gave us valuable insights and increased our confidence and engagement for participatory design processes. With this intervention we had the feedback that we needed but also, we were happy to share our design and process. Some people were more interested in the printing part and others with the digitalization kit, but overall, it was a nice experience that motivated us to keep on this direction.

**3rd Workshop — Ateneu de Fabricació La Fàbrica del Sol**

This workshop will be the last one, being part of the MDEFest. For this one we will repeat the Screen-printing with the final version of the prototype. For this one we collaborated with Ateneu de Fabricació de La Fàbrica del Sol, a space where they curate workshops, teach about digital fabrication and facilitate these tools to develop projects.

### Tile Design & Making

After the two screen-printing workshops, we decided to use our pattern grid for another application. We decided to look for ceramic studios in order to make a possible collaboration. We found a ceramic artist named Evan Powel from "Studio 137" in Poblenou. We introduced ourselves and shared our project. We visited Evan's workshop at TMDC, where he showed interest in collaborating with us.

After brainstorming, we decided to use our gadget to create hydraulic tiles, an old technique for making tiles. For this process we needed to digitalize the shapes to make a mold. To achieve this, we connected the pattern system with the hydraulic tiles process. So once the system scans the shape, this is converted to vectors and those are extruded to create surfaces. These surfaces will become the mold to slip the liquid cement of different colors and create the shapes into the tile.

This process is really artisan, it needs a perfect combination of components, such as cement, sand, marble, pigments, and water, and they must be high pressed with a hydraulic press. We tried to make it simple and with standard or DIY tools. So, we prepared the color and cement mixtures to decorate the tiles. Normally, powdered color pigments are mixed with white cement and water. Instead, we used acrylic color pigments and mixed them with gray cement. To ensure a good result and avoid large particles, we sifted the gray cement.

We filled the 3D printed frame with the color pigments and cement mixtures according to the desired decoration. After removing the 3D printed frame, we added more cement by sifting it on top. In the first trial, we added a mixture of sand and cement on top and applied a lot of pressure with the hydraulic press, but it didn't work. For the second trial, we only added cement on top, but it resulted in a dry and uneven finish. In the third and final trial, we applied thinner layers of cement, sprayed water on each layer, and used 2 tons of pressure with the hydraulic press.

Once we decided to organize the hydraulic tile workshop for MDEFest, we searched for the tile mixture recipe. Since it's an ancient craft, finding a specific recipe was challenging. We contacted with a tile making manufacturer in order to ask for guidance for the recipe, but he told us that is secret. Even so he gave us some advice and told us the main components and the steps of the process.

Basically, a hydraulic tile has three layers: the top layer made of marble powder, white cement, color pigments, and water; the middle layer made of fine gray cement; and the bottom layer made of a mixture of sand and cement. For the second trial, we got marble powder and white cement and made several attempts to get the best results. We experimented with different ratios for the top and bottom layers to improve the production process.

This exploration took us a lot of try and error by changing the components mixture, adjusting the pressure, the humidity, and the tools that we have created. One of them it has been the frame that holds the tile from slipping once it is being pressed. This evolved in multiple iterations, as well as the 3D printed mold that separates the shapes for different colors.

This intervention also will be part of the MDEFest, where we will try to show people the potential of this mixed process between physical interaction and digital fabrication. As well as, our aim is to revalue the craft process and show the hard work that is behind a final crafted piece.
