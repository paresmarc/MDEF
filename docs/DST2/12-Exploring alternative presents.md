# Exploring alternative presents
**Explore biographies and analyze the way of drifting in order to make sense of the alternative present**

## Map, visualize and analyze the evolution of design space

Present Continuities
- Context description where we are trying to reach
- Checking present situations

- People is interested in doing ceramics in a mindfulness way, only a selfish experience to try to recover themselves from their daily lives.

Alternative Present
- What i am designing for society and trying to change something

- Designing a system to recover pieces of ceramics lost because civil war of Spain. Work with New Tech to reinterpret the pieces. AI to rethink


**Marian Burgues project**

- Recovery of his ceramics, innovation, transmitting what he contributed to the world of ceramics (search for documents, pieces lost due to the civil war, repression)
- Create a ceramic design studio that bases its designs on lost pieces of the past, transmit local traditions, remember and communicate unknown ceramicists (create a personal link with the extraditions to motivate people to recover and value them)
- Application of new technologies to make it more attractive to new generations (3d print, AI, 3d scan)
- Location of the studio next to the ceramic school of la bisbal, seek collaboration from the students, give them knowledge and communication, receive ideas and labor in return. take advantage of the building under construction of the LB ceramics school to do the study, apply new tech machines and combination with a traditional ceramic workshop.
- Critical thinking about AI, how to apply it. Training with concepts from the past, not trying to generate new things, but reviving and reinterpreting the past with a tool that tries to be futuristic. Train her with images of ceramic pieces (direct concept), images and descriptions of the situation (description of the context, understand how she was influenced and what she was talking about at that time), description of the profile of the artists/artisans (what the people were like what did they create?)
