# Exploring alternative presents
**Explore biographies and analyze the way of drifting in order to make sense of the alternative present**

## Map, visualize and analyze the evolution of design space

**Present Continuities**
Context description where we are trying to reach
Checking present situations

- People is interested in doing ceramics in a mindfulness way, only a selfish experience to try to recover themselves from their daily lives.

**Alternative Present**
What I am designing for society trying to change something

- Designing a system to recover pieces of ceramics lost because civil war of Spain. Work with New Tech to reinterpret the pieces. AI to rethink


**Marian Burgu√®s project**

- Recovery of his ceramics, innovation, transmitting what he contributed to the world of ceramics (search for documents, pieces lost due to the civil war, repression)
- Create a design method that bases on searching lost pieces of the past and make new versions of them using new technologies.
- Transmit local traditions, remember and communicate unknown ceramicists (create a personal link with the extraditions to motivate people to recover and value them)
- Application of new technologies to make it more attractive to new generations (3d print, AI, 3d scan).
- Through preserved pieces or parts, images or texts, make reinterpretations. Using this sources and with AI create new designs. Once having a digital file, translate it to a 3D model and fabricate them using new technologies, such as 3D printing.
- Critical thinking about AI, how to apply it. Training with concepts from the past, not trying to generate new things, but reviving and reinterpreting the past with a tool that tries to be futuristic. Train her with images of ceramic pieces (direct concept), images and descriptions of the situation (description of the context, understand how she was influenced and what she was talking about at that time), description of the profile of the artists/artisans (what the people were like what did they create?)

Thinking of a Design Studio with this idea
- Location of the studio next to the ceramic school of La Bisbal, seek collaboration from the students, give them knowledge and communication, receive ideas and labor in return. take advantage of the building under construction of the LB ceramics school to do the study, apply new tech machines and combination with a traditional ceramic workshop.
