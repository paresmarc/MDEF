# Reframing by Reflecting
**Reframing by Reflecting on my project so far**

## My journey

The first term has been a beautiful but hard process where I have had to reflect on who I am and who I want to be, professionally but also personally. I quickly established myself in the duality of crafts and technology because it was a field in which I was interested prior to beginning the master's and in which I had already completed some projects. 

From this idea, I started thinking about ceramics and the local traditions around them. Catalonia has a long history of pottery, and my mother's family is from La Bisbal, where ceramics have long been the main economic driver. I started researching the traditions and the current situation, where nowadays craftsmen don’t have a heritage to share their knowledge because new generations are more interested in moving to big cities and studying in innovative fields. However, in Barcelona, there is a boom in doing ceramics, people are interested in doing pottery in their free time, as an activity of introspection and to take a break from their busy lives. So, I find interesting this contradiction where in cities, there is an extended interest in pottery, but in rural areas, we are losing the professionalisation of ceramics.

I struggled with the uncertainty of the design process. Sometimes for me, it is difficult to be confident in myself and believe I am doing things right, so with this term that was about exploring without having an objective, I had a lot of ups and downs.

I have done some interventions (Pottery with Love and Where Clay Comes From).

With these interventions, I have made contact with some interesting people related to pottery. I have met the director of the ceramic school in La Bisbal. With this, I look forward to collaborating with some of them in the second term to learn from them, to do interventions, and to become collaborators.

### Learnings
Reflecting on these experiences, it's clear that they have all contributed to personal and professional growth in different ways.

Having knowledge about a lot of different fields has opened up new perspectives and possibilities for the future. This broad understanding allows for a more informed decision-making process and a greater appreciation for the interconnectedness of different disciplines. It also helps to identify opportunities for collaboration and innovation.

Learning to improvise and not knowing where I am going has taught me the importance of adaptability and resilience. By embracing uncertainty and taking risks, I have been able to grow and learn from all the new inputs that come my way. This mindset has allowed me to tackle challenges and seize opportunities that I may have otherwise overlooked.

Being more open-minded and learning about new people, cultures, and contexts has broadened my horizons and enriched my understanding of the world. This has allowed me to connect with others on a deeper level and appreciate diversity and differences.

Working and learning together in an open design process has taught me the power of collaboration and co-creation. By pooling together different perspectives and skills, we can create more innovative and inclusive solutions. This process also fosters a sense of collective ownership and accountability, which is vital for creating meaningful and sustainable change.

Finally, engaging in a first-person perspective design process has allowed me to become one more of the collective. This means that I am no longer solely focused on my own needs and desires, but rather, I am part of a larger community with shared values and goals. By working towards a common purpose, we can achieve more than we ever could as individuals.

### Design Dialogues
After receiving feedback on my Design Dialogues I final term presentation, I have reflected on several key learnings that I can take away from the experience.

Firstly, I was encouraged to think about possible future interventions for my project. This taught me that there is still room for improvement and development in my work, and that I should continue to explore new ideas and approaches in order to push the boundaries of my project.

Secondly, I was given specific ideas for my project, such as new combinations that I could explore. This showed me that there are many creative possibilities that I could consider, and that I should remain open to new ideas and perspectives in order to evolve as a designer.

Thirdly, I was reminded of the importance of talking to people and making contacts in order to communicate my project and ideas effectively. This taught me that engaging with a diverse range of stakeholders is crucial in ensuring that my work is relevant and impactful.

Finally, I was given references and new contacts that I can use to further develop my work and to expand my network. This provided me with an invaluable opportunity to connect with other designers and industry experts, and to learn from their experiences and insights.

Overall, the feedback I received from my Design Dialogues I final term presentation has provided me with a roadmap for future development and growth. By taking these learnings on board and continuing to push myself creatively, I can become an even more effective and impactful designer, and make a real difference in the world of design.
