# Reframing by Reflecting
**Reframing by Reflecting on my project so far**

## My journey

The first term has been a beautiful but hard process where I have had to reflect on who I am and who I want to be, professionally but also personally. I quickly established myself in the duality of crafts and technology because it was a field in which I was interested prior to beginning the master's and in which I had already completed some projects. 

From this idea, I started thinking about ceramics and the local traditions around them. Catalonia has a long history of pottery, and my mother's family is from La Bisbal, where ceramics have long been the main economic driver. I started researching the traditions and the current situation, where nowadays craftsmen don’t have a heritage to share their knowledge because new generations are more interested in moving to big cities and studying in innovative fields. However, in Barcelona, there is a boom in doing ceramics, people are interested in doing pottery in their free time, as an activity of introspection and to take a break from their busy lives. So, I find interesting this contradiction where in cities, there is an extended interest in pottery, but in rural areas, we are losing the professionalisation of ceramics.

I struggled with the uncertainty of the design process. Sometimes for me, it is difficult to be confident in myself and believe I am doing things right, so with this term that was about exploring without having an objective, I had a lot of ups and downs.

I have done some interventions (Pottery with Love and Where Clay Comes From).

With these interventions, I have made contact with some interesting people related to pottery. I have met the director of the ceramic school in La Bisbal. With this, I look forward to collaborating with some of them in the second term to learn from them, to do interventions, and to become collaborators.

### Learnings
- knowledge about a lot of different fields, opening my mind and my future expectations
- learning to improvise and not knowing were I am going, and growing with all the new inputs
- more open minded, learning about new people, cultures, contexts
- working and learning together (open design process)
- first person perspective design process, becoming one more of the collective

### Design Dialogues
- possible future interventions
- specific ideas for my project, new combinations
- the need to talk to people and make contacts, explaining and communicating my project and ideas without a defined design only with a intention
- referents and new contacts
