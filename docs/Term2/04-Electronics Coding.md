# Electronics & Coding

## Reflections

This week we started Digital Prototyping. I am very excited to learn about this topic to be able to implement it to my future projects. We started with basic electronics. I do not have any background in electronics so starting it is a little overwelming.


## Basic Electronics

We had a theoretical introduction to have a general idea of all the elements that constitute an electronic circuit.

Microcontroller MCU
	Arduino
		Components
			— board (hardware)
			— digital interface (software)
			— community (collaboration, opensource)
		Milis — time

SBCs — single board computer
	Raspberry Pi


Adafruit —

Opensource — share a like, if you do a modification you are forced to share it
IP — Intelectual Property
Permissives IP licenses

### First Assignment

Make some music with the board and a simple buzzer


## Inputs & Outputs



### Second Assignment
