# Remixing Materials

## Reflections

This seminar made us reflect on bio-materials, and how we can reuse waste in a ecologic way. I have never tryed to make a bio-plastic so this classes have been really interesting to experiment and do a lot of hands-on learning. Coming from a product design background it is difficult for me to change my perspective about production and realising that we can use bio-materials. This materials are not the best in terms of physical properties, easy production neither economically, but are the best in terms of thinking for a sustainable world.


## Material narratives

**Tiger Nut â€“ Chufa**

- What is the story behind them (who did them, why, where it comes from)

    <td width="50%"> In Spain, Chufa is used to prepare a typical drink known as horchata. It is made from soaked, ground and sweetened tiger nuts mixed with sugar and water. Ice cream shops produce horchata by crushing and pressing chufa and there is a lot of waste, so we tried to find a reuse.</td>
