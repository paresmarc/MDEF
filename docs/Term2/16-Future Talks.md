# Future Talks

## Audrey Desjardins

During the seminar led by Audrey Desjardins, we discussed the potential benefits and limitations of design research methods in psychotherapy. We were joined by a participant who shared an article that discussed the ethical concerns and potential risks involved in using design research in psychotherapy without appropriate training and licensure.

We agreed that while design research can be a valuable tool for understanding user experiences and designing better products, it may not always be appropriate in a therapeutic context. The participant emphasized the importance of maintaining professional boundaries and avoiding the blurring of roles between different fields, which is a key aspect of providing ethical and effective psychotherapy.

We also discussed the importance of informed consent and ethical considerations when using design research methods in psychotherapy. We acknowledged that clients should not be subjected to harm or exploitation, and that ethical guidelines and standards of practice should be developed to ensure the safety and well-being of clients.

Overall, our discussion highlighted the importance of being mindful of the potential risks and ethical concerns involved in using design research in psychotherapy, and the need for appropriate training, licensure, and ethical guidelines for professionals in this field. We recognized that while design research can be a powerful tool for understanding user experiences and creating better products, it should be used responsibly and with an understanding of its limitations in a therapeutic context.


## Laura Forlano

In a seminar led by Laura Forlano, we explored the intersection of technology, culture, and society, and how technology can be designed to better meet the needs of people and communities. One topic we discussed was the importance of understanding experiences and perspectives from a first-person point of view. For example, Laura's work on cyborgs and disabilities has shown how people with disabilities can benefit from technology, but it's important to approach this design from a first-person perspective to ensure it meets their needs.

Another important topic we discussed was the role of digital communities, especially for people who have difficulties finding peers in their geographical region. Laura has deep-dived on Reddit communities and has found that they can be a valuable resource for people with medical conditions or disabilities who may have trouble finding peers locally.

She also introduced us to the concept of vignettes as a tool for capturing unique moments that can inform the design process. By writing up a vignette to make sense of a story, designers can better understand the needs of the people they are designing for.

We also discussed the importance of designing machines and technology that can assist in the care industry, while being mindful of the limitations and challenges that may arise. Laura's work in this area has shown how technology can improve the quality of care for patients and healthcare professionals, but it's important to consider the ethical implications of using AI in various contexts, including plagiarism and control over the technology.

Throughout the seminar, we maintained a curious and reflective mindset while exploring new concepts and technologies. Laura's work and insights have been a valuable contribution to our understanding of how technology can be designed to better serve people and communities.

## Frederick Van Amstel

During this seminar led by Frederick van Amstel, we explored the concept of "dise√±o libre" and how it intersects with oppression and design, with a particular focus on integrating indigenous perspectives into design.

His work often explores themes of identity, perception, and the relationship between humans and technology, and he is known for creating immersive installations, sculptures, and digital art.

One key takeaway from his conversation is that politics cannot be excluded from design, and working in an open-source, open-data manner is, in itself, a political stance. This aligns with his artistic vision, which often incorporates his artistic perspective into his design work, creating unique and visually striking spaces.

Frederick's work emphasizes the need to acknowledge and challenge the impact of colonialism on relationships, starting with the human body. His talk sparked some personal reflections, including how to collaborate with indigenous communities without extracting knowledge and resorting to colonial ways of relating. Additionally, there was an interest in exploring how our bodies relate to oppression and what exercises could be used to acknowledge this.

Furthermore, Frederick highlighted that privilege is contextually defined based on geography and how people perceive one's accent, skin tone, and racial features. He shared how he is perceived as an immigrant Latino man in Europe, despite being Dutch-Brazilian. This conversation raised questions about how to discuss politics intersecting with design in various scenarios without creating a threatening environment.

Overall, Frederick's work and seminar challenge traditional approaches to design and encourage collaboration, open-source, and open-data methods as a political stance. His work emphasizes the importance of acknowledging the impact of colonialism on relationships and exploring the relationship between humans, technology, and identity.
