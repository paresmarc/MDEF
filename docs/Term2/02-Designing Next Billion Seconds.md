# Designing for the Next Billion Seconds

## Reflections

This seminar made me reflect on how we perceive our world and look it wit a mode critical perspective. This was during the first week of the second term so it was really useful to get back to work, reflecto on how we have been working and developing our project, and to recover the progress from the point where we left off.

During the seminar, we delved into several critical concepts that are essential for improving our collective future. The first concept that stood out was the importance of taking a stance against issues such as racism and hate. It was emphasized that we cannot remain neutral and must actively work towards eliminating these harmful attitudes and behaviors from our society.

We also explored the two different approaches to address the environmental crisis - degrowth and green growth. We weighed the pros and cons of both approaches, but it was clear that significant changes are necessary in our current economic system to ensure a sustainable and just future.

Another topic of discussion was the idea that economies can be slowed down either by design or by disaster. We looked at policies and regulations that prioritize sustainability and how they can lead to a steady and sustainable economy that benefits everyone. However, we also recognized that disasters such as pandemics and economic crises can also have a similar effect.

We also discussed the idea that people's actions can be evil, even if they themselves are not inherently evil. It was emphasized that we should promote education, empathy, and awareness to help people change their harmful behaviors and attitudes.

We also stressed the importance of resisting harmful attitudes such as "us versus them" and "othering" to create a more inclusive and just society. By promoting empathy, compassion, and understanding, we can build stronger communities that embrace diversity.

Finally, we talked about the potential pitfalls of user-centered design. While this approach can be beneficial, it's essential to avoid selfish individualism by striking a balance between user needs and social responsibility.

It was clear that we cannot remain neutral when it comes to issues such as racism and hate and that significant changes are necessary in our current economic system to ensure a sustainable and just future.

We also recognized the importance of designing policies and regulations that prioritize sustainability to achieve a steady and sustainable economy that benefits everyone.
