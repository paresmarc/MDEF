# El Hierro Research Trip

## First Ideas

The main goal of this project is to document the beautiful natural landscapes found on this island. I want to capture the unique textures of the environment and compare them to the textures found in Barcelona city.

One aspect that I find particularly interesting is the comparison between skins and surfaces. I want to explore how our sense of touch changes when we interact with different places. How does the feeling of touching the volcanic rocks on El Hierro differ from the feeling of touching a building in Barcelona?

I believe that the shapes around us can have a significant impact on our quality of life. I always like to touch things and I think this is an underrated sense. Sometimes we don't take the time to appreciate the physical sensations of the world around us.

El Hierro is an island with a diverse landscape that changes rapidly. From forests to volcanic rocks to the sea, there are many textures to explore. To capture these textures, I plan to use 3D scanning technology to create digital models of plants, trees, rocks, water, and aquatic life (if possible).

However, the challenge with digitalization is that touch is one of the senses that is difficult to represent in a digital source. So I am trying to find a way to translate the feelings of 3D textures to a 2D image or video. One solution is to engrave the textures on paper, which will transport the physicality to another physical object in order to share the sensations of walking through a real landscape. Another solution is to 3D print the shapes to create tangible objects.

In addition, I plan to use sound to enhance the viewer's experience. By applying the touch sound of the real textures, and adding it to the 3D models, the audience can feel like they are touching the textures themselves.

Overall, I believe this research trip video to El Hierro will be an exciting opportunity to explore the textures of the natural environment and compare them to urban landscapes. I hope to capture the essence of the island and share it with the world.

## El Hierro Textures

So, for my final project idea, I want to create a research trip video in El Hierro. My main goal is to document the textures of the local natural landscape, to understand how we interact with things and how shapes can change our quality of life.

I'm particularly interested in making a comparison between different skins and surfaces, exploring how the feeling of touching changes between places. El Hierro is a fantastic location for this project because the landscape changes so fast between nature, forests, volcanic rocks, sea, and so on.

To capture these textures, I plan to use 3D scanning technology to scan natural textures, shapes, and other elements like plants, trees, rocks, water, and so on. The idea is to create a detailed database of all these textures that can be analyzed later.

Another concept that I want to explore is the idea of decontextualization. In other words, I want to propose a game where the user can't recognize the context because the video only shows the textures. It will be raw shapes that the user can analyze freely. This concept is particularly interesting because it allows us to explore the textures without any preconceived notions or biases based on the context.

This research trip video will be a fascinating exploration of textures, shapes, and the natural landscape in El Hierro. It will be a valuable resource for anyone interested in design, architecture, and the natural world.

## Digital Textures

The aim of this project is to digitally capture and preserve objects and textures from nature and replicate them in different media. In order to achieve this, the organic forms must be converted into a polygonal mesh, with the level of decimation determining the accuracy of preservation. However, a key question arises: to what extent does the decimation process compromise the authenticity of the organic shape? At what point does the structure become unrecognizable?

This project challenges the notion of preserving living organisms, structures, and sacred objects through photogrammetry, and explores the potential benefits of promoting a sustainable relationship with nature. By preserving these forms digitally, we can avoid causing physical damage to the real-world objects, while also fostering greater appreciation for their beauty and importance.

— How do we perceive textures? and how can they be translated to digital?

— How does digitalization enhance our interaction with textures?

— Finding the limit of texture recognition without context.
