Product designer from Barcelona with the ambition of searching new shapes between technology and crafts. Currently, interested in local craftsmanship such as ceramics, but also in modern technologies of production such as 3D printing.

Materializing his concepts on pieces with a duality of functionality and visual attraction. His products are defined by eye appeal, ergonomic, an intrinsic concept and the intention of creating a experience.

In this master, I am looking forward to developing a system to help local artisans share and continue their traditional techniques while combining them with innovative production processes.
