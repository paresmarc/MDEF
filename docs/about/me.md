I am a product designer based in Barcelona, and my passion lies in exploring the intersection of technology and craftsmanship to create unique and functional designs. My approach to design is driven by my interest in designing products using cutting-edge technologies to push the boundaries of what is possible.

I have a particular fascination with digital crafts and enjoy exploring new technologies and tools to bring my ideas to life while engaging experience for the user.

Currently, I am exploring local craftsmanship, such as ceramics, as well as modern production technologies, like 3D printing. I am constantly seeking out new and innovative ways to design and produce my work, and I'm excited to collaborate with other studios to learn and grow my skill set.

If you're interested in collaborating on a project or have any questions about my design philosophy, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always excited to connect with like-minded individuals and explore new opportunities to create meaningful designs.
