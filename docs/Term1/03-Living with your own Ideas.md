# Living with your own Ideas
## Make a Companion

### Creation and expectations

<img src="https://paresmarc.github.io/MDEF/images/companion1.jpg" width="50%" height="50%"/>


Ecology:
Reflect about saving water

Capitalism:
The need to have it all

Minimalist lifestyle
— eliminate what is not essential

Minimalism is an antidote to that state of overload
— back to rural places

Bottle that makes you suffer during a day to realize all necessary things and the not essential ones.


### Living with it 24 hours

Living together for 24 hours

How I lived together?
— tried to drink from it (stupid/useless)
— I had to search other ways to get water

What does it notice?
— tried to drink so much times, I realized how much I need water to continue with my life
— I usually drink very little water

Why does it matter?
— suffer, feeling humiliated (introspection)
— essential and not essential


## 1PP Exploration

### Experience

How would it be to share a craft experience in the physical world and import it into the digital?

I started my day by trying to experiment with clay. I wanted to feel it with all my senses. I went to a ceramic studio, and I mixed clay powder with water to start experimenting. Then I poured the liquid clay into a cast board to make it more controllable.

I left the studio with a bag full of clay. Local red clay dirties your hands a lot while working with it. I tried to continue my day always with clay in my hands, looking forward to experiencing different activities thanks to the clay's interaction with me.

I also wanted to see how people would react to me. I walked the streets, playing with the clay in my hands.   I also wanted to try eating with my dirty hands. So I had lunch while grabbing clay and interacting with all the objects with clay in between. It was difficult to use the fork, but I liked the experience because the smell of the wet clay changed my perception of the food.

After that, I decided to share that experience with other people. So in the evening, I met with some friends, and I asked them to play with clay or plasticine while talking and having a beer. I enjoyed that everyone made something unique and experienced the hangout differently. Some people tried to produce a lot, they wanted to impress others and make something special.   

On the other hand, others enjoyed the process, they played with the clay while talking, without searching for a result. I saw one of them evolve his ball of clay, he made a lot of shapes with the same clay and destroyed it every time. Finally, he gave me a weird ball that had no social meaning except for the time he spent with it and the conversations that he had around it.   

I decided to bring that analogue and physical experience to the digital world. I selected one of the creations, the weird ball. I 3D scanned it to make a digital copy, document it, and preserve it. The preservation of art and traditions is something so important for culture and society, but we are losing it because the world is evolving fast. I used the EM3D app, which works with infrared, to generate a 3D model of the clay ball.

After that, I prepared the file for 3D printing with Cura, and I tried to print it with the same characteristics. The result was brilliant, both shapes looked similar. I find this process so interesting because it permits every person to model something in 3D. You don’t need to learn 3D digital software, only with your hands and by experiencing the physical sensations of the clay can you generate something unique and then import it into the digital world. 

### Reflection

From that experience, I can draw some conclusions. Introducing the clay to the bar table made everyone participate in the same action, and thanks to that, a lot of conversations were generated. We talked about crafts and traditions. We generated objects from a social experience that reminded me of a moment. With 3D scanning and printing, I can generate copies of and preserve a shape that, given some time, would be destroyed. The connection between the physical and digital, and the traditions and innovation are hybrid concepts that really interest me.

Another exploration concept is the time of creation that needs a human person and the time that uses a machine to try to create a similar shape. The time spent by my friend creating the shape was about an hour, he experienced the clay and used that process to share his experience and talk and interact with others. Comparing it with the 3D printer, bypassing the time I spent 3D scanning and slicing the file, it was 1 hour and 22 minutes. So the time of fabrication is similar, but, indeed, machines cannot create, they only follow human indications. At least for now, who knows how AI would evolve in the future?

Can machines create culture and traditions?
