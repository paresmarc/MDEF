# Tech beyond the Myth
## Forensics of the Obsolescence

### Disassembly
- Brother printer

1. Analyzed general functions, components and interactions.
2. Removed main back screws and began dismantling.
3. Separated paper trays and components that were easy to remove.
4. Removed ink cartridges
5. Forced removal of two hinges that connected the upper and lower sections.
6. Start disassembling the scanner & printer parts.
7. Disassemble the outer casing.
8. Disassemble the inside components, ink supply units, PCBs, covers, units, rollers, motors, cables, screws, sensors.
9. Separate individual components by function. Ink supply, Printing, Scanning, Sensing, Moving, Transferring.
10. Separate the components by type (chips, motors, cables, sensors, cases).
11. Researched, analyzed and understood data sheets and main functions of each component.

### Forensic Control
