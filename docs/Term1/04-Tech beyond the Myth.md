# Tech beyond the Myth
## Forensics of the Obsolescence

I started this week very excited to learn about electronics and programming. After having taken theoretical classes about translating physics to information, binary code, how computers think, etc., we formed groups and chose a damaged electronic object to disassemble and study its operation and components.

What surprised me about this seminar was how, in two weeks, I learned, without previous experience or knowledge on the subject, very different concepts: programming, mechanisms, manufacturing processes, economic models of product companies, etc., that have opened a door to a whole new world for me. Technology is no longer a black box, and from now on I am curious to explore how products work and what their true purpose is.

Our team chose to disassemble a broken inkjet printer that combines a printer, scanner, fax, and copier. Below are the steps we followed and a video of the disassembly process.

### Disassembly
**Brother printer**

1. Analyzed general functions, components and interactions.
2. Removed main back screws and began dismantling.
3. Separated paper trays and components that were easy to remove.
4. Removed ink cartridges
5. Forced removal of two hinges that connected the upper and lower sections.
6. Start disassembling the scanner & printer parts.
7. Disassemble the outer casing.
8. Disassemble the inside components, ink supply units, PCBs, covers, units, rollers, motors, cables, screws, sensors.
9. Separate individual components by function. Ink supply, Printing, Scanning, Sensing, Moving, Transferring.
10. Separate the components by type (chips, motors, cables, sensors, cases).
11. Researched, analyzed and understood data sheets and main functions of each component.

## The Right to Hack

## Rethink and Reconnect

### Design

Once we had all components tear appart we had to build an Almost Useless Machine. We started looking for referents:

**Tinkering**

We tested different parts and components.
We integrated different components and designed systems that interact with each other.
We brainstormed and discussed about the type of device we would like to build.
We built Knock Knock.


Different ideas of sound, light and behavior emerged through the chaos/ process of playing.


**Concept**

KNOCK-KNOCK is an automatic annoying machine that knocks on your door until you open it, then it stops ... until you close it again.

It wants your attention
It wants to interrupt your life
Takes you away from social networks
It tries to be funny


**Design**

**Reflections**

What did we learn?

By disassembling everyday electronic objects, we can get a better understanding of how they are built, how society is built around them and how little we actually know about what we use.

It’s very fun to explore electronics. To build new things with existing parts and objects. Hacking broken products to reuse some parts is an excellent way to recycle and reduce our waste.

It’s hard to make something useless. As soon as you start reflecting on which functions it has it can become useful.
