# Roles of prototyping

Role 1: The prototype as an experimental component

The prototype as an experimental component. Prototyping tests an abstract hypothesis. This type searches for body interaction between the user and the product tested. It also looks for an experience, how the user learns how to interact with it, for what is meant and creates a positive experience. Finally aims to show and experiment with some details of the shape such as textures, colours, shadows, physical conditions, etc.

Role2: The prototype as a means of inquiry

The prototype as a means of inquiry where prototypes are developed and deployed as instruments of inquiry to collect, record and measure phenomena.
Explore and understand a phenomenon, situation, or experience to get validation for the final users. Capture information, such as material properties or personal behaviour. Also can provoke a specific situation to collect data on the experience and interaction between the user and the design. Instigate a specific reaction to make the users tell you extreme opinions and situations and get ready for future problems.
Asks how people will use the final product, making statistics and getting results. Time and costs will determine the prototype.
