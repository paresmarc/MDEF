# Streaming Pottery

Streaming online the ceramic process in order to show the real process behind the final pieces. Nowadays, there is a boom in the pottery experience. In the city of Barcelona, there are a lot of workshops where you can spend time after a long working day. This workshop offers a relaxed and mindful experience where everyone can interact with a physical material that takes you back to the real world after spending many hours in front of screens.

These workshops are promoting a lot of the craftsmen's processes as pottery, but they are also devaluing the work of the artisans. A lot of people think that they can create art by spending a few hours playing with clay, while craftsmen spend their lives developing their unique techniques with a delicate vision.

TikTok videos and social media are making every process seem really easy. This videos are short, with a lot of visual and voice inputs, and with shapes and sounds that transmit a short but high amount of satisfaction. These videos make everything appear simple, but they teach nothing.

My idea is to go back to video tutorials, where the aim was to communicate how to make something and teach the viewer. Also, in conjunction with the new trend of streaming, I want to use Twitch to share this process.

I was contacted by a pottery studio to collaborate on some kind of project, and I took advantage of the opportunity to explain this idea. They were really engaged from the first moment, they found it interesting to connect more with new generations but also with other ceramicists.
