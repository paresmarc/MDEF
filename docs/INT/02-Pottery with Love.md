# To Pottery with Love

Intervention to search the meaning of Love through the interaction with clay. We asked some colleagues and ceramicists to reflect on how they see love and what their own definition is.

This workshop was interesting for me to learn how to organise a workshop, to engage people, and to create an interesting and meaningful experience that can help others reflect on some concepts or start a new activity that can lead to a future hobby.

To see how people interact with clay and if they care about which type they use. We asked them to bring their own clay, but at the end, in the studio they usually use the same type of clay, a basic white one that is easy to work with and that is not too dirty (Prai from Sio2).

One positive acknowledgement I extract from doing this workshop is that we did it intuitively and without knowing where we wanted to go. We were just interested in working with clay and looking for a reflection on love. I think the design process is usually a difficult path where you can get lost if you are not confident in what you are doing, so trying things and doing them is the best way to gain confidence in ourselves and trust the project.

Finally, it was also useful to start creating a community around my project and my context. Doing this workshop in El Torn opened my vision of local ceramics to a new group, which is foreigner ceramicists that came to work or study to Barcelona and do ceramics on their free time.
