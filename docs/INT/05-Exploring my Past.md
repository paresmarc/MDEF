# Exploring my Past

Our concept involves creating a system that retrieves ceramics that were lost during the Spanish Civil War, with the aim of reviving historical crafting techniques and artifacts. We plan to merge traditional methods with modern technology to make them more appealing to younger generations.

Our objective is to emphasize the worth of handmade goods and encourage transparency in the production process through an open-source strategy.

At present, we are in the process of developing an AI-driven system that generates contemporary versions of regional ceramics from preserved sources like fragmented pieces, images, or written material.
