# Exploring my Past

My project involves creating a system that retrieves lost ceramics from the Spanish Civil War era. The goal is to revive historical crafting techniques and artifacts by merging traditional methods with modern technology to make them more appealing to younger generations.

The main objective of the project is to emphasize the value of handmade goods and encourage transparency in the production process through an open-source approach. Currently, I am working on developing an AI-driven system that can generate contemporary versions of regional ceramics using preserved sources such as fragmented pieces, images, or written material.

## Areas that I have been exploring:

**1. Personal connection with Ceramics**

- Miquel Bertran — Clay extrusion machine Mechanic

- Marian Burguès — Catalan Ceramicist

- Get back Traditional Ceramics

- Reinterpretate past through New Technologies

- Bring back the Utility to Ceramics

**2. Pottery in Combination with Technologies**

- 3D Printing with Clay

- Collaboration with 3D Clay Studio

BCN 3D Ceramics, Martí Baltà

- Water Project, brik, filter. Robocasting and Binderjet

- Searcing applications of 3D Print Ceramics

- AI 3D Model Generator through Text Prompt
Using AI as a tool to research in the past, not trying to surpass the human creative mind

## Exploring the Intersection of Pottery and Technology:

- Innovative Techniques for Clay Modelling

- Collaborative Ceramics Studio with 3D Printing

- Revolutionary BCN 3D Ceramics by Martí Baltà

- Advancements in Ceramic Design for Sustainable Water Projects

- Applications of 3D Printing in Ceramics

- AI-powered 3D Model Generation through Textual Input

- Leveraging AI for Historical Research in Ceramics without Challenging Human Creativity.

*This intervention is still in process*

## Marian Burguès project

- Recovery of his ceramics, innovation, transmitting what he contributed to the world of ceramics (search for documents, pieces lost due to the civil war, repression)

- Create a design method that bases on searching lost pieces of the past and make new versions of them using new technologies.

- Transmit local traditions, remember and communicate unknown ceramicists (create a personal link with the extraditions to motivate people to recover and value them)

- Application of new technologies to make it more attractive to new generations (3d print, AI, 3d scan).

- Through preserved pieces or parts, images or texts, make reinterpretations. Using this sources and with AI create new designs. Once having a digital file, translate it to a 3D model and fabricate them using new technologies, such as 3D printing.

- Critical thinking about AI, how to apply it. Training with concepts from the past, not trying to generate new things, but reviving and reinterpreting the past with a tool that tries to be futuristic. Train her with images of ceramic pieces (direct concept), images and descriptions of the situation (description of the context, understand how she was influenced and what she was talking about at that time), description of the profile of the artists/artisans (what the people were like what did they create?)

**Thinking of a Design Studio with this idea**

- Location of the studio next to the ceramic school of La Bisbal, seek collaboration from the students, give them knowledge and communication, receive ideas and labor in return. take advantage of the building under construction of the LB ceramics school to do the study, apply new tech machines and combination with a traditional ceramic workshop.
